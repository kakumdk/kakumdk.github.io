                            <p>Teeth are naturally yellowish white in color, but if your teeth look more yellowish then that means your teeth are about to compromise aesthetically.</p>  <p>Here are the few reasons mentioned below by which teeth change to yellowish.</p>  <ol> <li><strong>Food and Drinks</strong>: If we take more acidic beverages, coffee, tea and highly pigmented food substances (like Blackberries, blueberries, pomegranates, and other dark berries), then there are more chances of teeth getting yellowish and stained.</li> <li><strong>Traumatic accidents of teeth</strong>: Tooth trauma is generally caused by accidental fall, this might lead to non-vitalization of teeth, which then lead to yellowish discoloration of teeth. This will generally happen to upper front teeth.</li> <li><strong>Without having a proper diet</strong>: Frequent intake of junk foods which are lacking in nutrition. This might lead to premature aging of teeth.</li> <li><strong>Natural yellowing</strong>: As age increases, naturally teeth color will change to yellowish.</li> <li><strong>Bruxism</strong>: Night grinding habit due to stress etc can cause attrition to teeth which lead to dentine exposure which is yellow in color.</li> </ol>  <p>Thanks for reading the Dentofacts article, for more such articles visit&nbsp;<a href='/dentofacts/index.html'>Dentofacts</a>.</p>
