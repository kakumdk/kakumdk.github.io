Subsequently, the diamond was cut into nine pieces and 97 fragments, with the largest of these pieces, Cullinan 2, also known as the Star of Africa, being set on a sceptre presented to Charles during his coronation. The other pieces are either on display in the Tower of London or the possession of the British royal family. Currently, there are demands from South African citizens to have the Cullinan diamonds returned as part of a larger movement to repatriate cultural artefacts.

Financial markets seem to be fairly confident that Erdogan will win. This is clear with a weakening of Turkish financial assets as the market prepares for another five-year term for the near-autocrat and his extremely unorthodox economic policies. While Erdogan won 49.51% in Sunday\u2019s presidential vote, and CHP candidate Kemal Kilicdaroglu won 45%, it was only enough for a run-off vote, with the winner requiring over 50%. However, in the parliamentary vote, Erdogan\u2019s AKP and partners won 322 of the 600 seats up for grabs, which means he will control parliament regardless. The argument that is likely to resonate with many Turkish voters is the one Erdogan is making sure is circulated incessantly: Because his party already will control parliament, a CHP president would introduce instability and potentially paralyze the government. Voting for Erdogan in the second round, then, is being billed as the only path to stability.","img":"https:\/\/d32r1sh890xpii.cloudfront.net\/article\/718x300\/2023-05-19_eu9w04zvbh.jpg","redirect_url":"https:\/\/oilprice.com\/Energy\/Energy-General\/Why-Erdogan-Is-Expected-To-Win-Turkeys-Presidential-Runoff.html","url":"\/Why-Erdogan-Is-Expected-To-Win-Turkeys-Presidential-Runoff.html","category":"World, South Korea","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2023-05-20T18:30:00+00:00"},"373":{"title":"India, South Korea To Deepen Ties In Trade, Defence","desc":"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday held productive bilateral talks with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol during which they agreed to deepen cooperation in areas like trade and investment, IT hardware manufacturing and defence and reaffirmed their commitment to further strengthen bilateral ties.

Uric acid is created when the human body breaks down purines which is a type of chemical. Health experts maintain that most uric acid dissolves in the blood, passes through the kidneys and leaves the body in urine.

They may appear fixed from Earth, but astronomers have long known that Saturn's innermost rings erode into its upper atmosphere due to the planet's intense gravity. So powerful is this gravitational pull, that bits and pieces of these icy rings raining down on the planet can fill up an Olympic-sized swimming pool every day! To better understand just how fast the rings are disappearing, scientists have roped in NASA's incredible James Webb Space Telescope and Hawaii's Keck Observatory to carry out long-term observations of the 'ring rain' phenomenon.
