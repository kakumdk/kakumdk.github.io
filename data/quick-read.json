The two black holes are then unable to lose any further kinetic energy in order to get even closer and merge. This is known as the final parsec problem. The presence of a third black hole can solve this problem.

It is twice the size of Mount Everest and will make its closest approach on July 14.<\/p>  <p>It was first spotted in 2017.

Comets are a mass of rock, ice, and gases that become &quot;active&quot; when warmed by a star. The C\/2017 K2 heading from the edge of the solar system was already bright when seen in 2017.

After mid-September, it will touch the hemisphere&#39;s southwestern horizon and shall be suitable for people viewing in the Southern Hemisphere.<\/li> <li>And the Skywatchers using a small telescope in a dark-sky site will witness a fuzzy patch of light around the C\/2017 K2&#39;s nucleus.
