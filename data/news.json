Moreover, these measures fail to discriminate between innocuous and allegedly harmful uses of the internet. To top it all off, such shutdowns are ordered not by the legislature, but by the executive.","img":"https:\/\/gumlet.assettype.com\/barandbench%2F2023-04%2Fa8e1be15-36d8-4cf6-adfc-dac8e96d85ba%2FBOMBAY__WEB_PAGE_1600x900_copy.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&format=webp&w=768&dpr=2.0","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.barandbench.com\/columns\/the-telecom-bills-internet-shutdown-switch-a-road-to-excessive-delegation","url":"\/the-telecom-bills-internet-shutdown-switch-a-road-to-excessive-delegation.html","category":"Tech, Internet","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2023-04-22T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"Quantum Jump: GoI does well to fund R&D in computing\u2019s next revolution","desc":"It is a measure of the mind-bending nature of quantum that the ground-breaking research of 1970s and 1980s into the phenomenon of entanglement, the heart of quantum science, was recognised with a Physics Nobel only in 2022.

Uric acid is created when the human body breaks down purines which is a type of chemical. Health experts maintain that most uric acid dissolves in the blood, passes through the kidneys and leaves the body in urine.

Financial markets seem to be fairly confident that Erdogan will win. This is clear with a weakening of Turkish financial assets as the market prepares for another five-year term for the near-autocrat and his extremely unorthodox economic policies. While Erdogan won 49.51% in Sunday\u2019s presidential vote and CHP candidate Kemal Kilicdaroglu won 45%, it was only enough for a run-off vote, with the winner requiring over 50%. However, in the parliamentary vote, Erdogan\u2019s AKP and partners won 322 of the 600 seats up for grabs, which means he will control parliament regardless. The argument that is likely to resonate with many Turkish voters is the one Erdogan is making sure is circulated incessantly: Because his party already will control parliament, a CHP president would introduce instability and potentially paralyze the government. Voting for Erdogan in the second round, then, is being billed as the only path to stability.","img":"https:\/\/d32r1sh890xpii.cloudfront.net\/article\/718x300\/2023-05-19_eu9w04zvbh.jpg","redirect_url":"https:\/\/oilprice.com\/Energy\/Energy-General\/Why-Erdogan-Is-Expected-To-Win-Turkeys-Presidential-Runoff.html","url":"\/Why-Erdogan-Is-Expected-To-Win-Turkeys-Presidential-Runoff.html","category":"World, South Korea","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2023-05-20T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"Endangered Species Day: Millions of species share the Earth with humans and they need our help","desc":"Endangered Species are any type of organism that is threatened with extinction across all or a significant portion of its range.

Subsequently, the diamond was cut into nine pieces and 97 fragments, with the largest of these pieces, Cullinan 2, also known as the Star of Africa, being set on a sceptre presented to Charles during his coronation.

The research provides critical insights into long-term changes to the glaciers and ice caps as a result of climate change, which has contributed about one fifth to global sea-level rise in the last decade. Using historical data, scientists mapped 5,327 glaciers and ice caps that existed at the end of the Little Ice Age in 1900, a period of wide-spread cooling when average global temperatures dropped by as much as 2\u00b0C. They were then able to reveal that these fragmented into 5,467 glaciers and ice caps by 2001. The study \u2013 Mass Loss of Glaciers and Ice Caps Across Greenland Since the Little Ice Age \u2013 published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, said Greenland\u2019s glaciers have lost at least 587 km3 of ice over the last century, accounting for 1.38 millimetres of sea-level rise.","img":"https:\/\/indiaeducationdiary.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/image-1-4-750x400.jpg","redirect_url":"https:\/\/indiaeducationdiary.in\/study-has-found-widespread-mass-loss-glaciers-in-greenland\/","url":"\/study-has-found-widespread-mass-loss-glaciers-in-greenland.html","category":"Science, Greenland","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2023-05-26T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"Chemical Reactions Spark Life Into Self-Folding Micro Origami Machines","desc":"A Cornell-led collaboration harnessed chemical reactions to make microscale origami machines self-fold \u2013 freeing them from the liquids in which they usually function, so they can operate in dry environments and at room temperature.

The QoL of about 67% of patients with advanced cancer is hampered by pain, a debilitating symptom that often presents with fatigue and insomnia. Although the treatment of pain in these patients relies majorly on the use of opioids, the ongoing opioid crisis limits the prescription of and access to these drugs. Additionally, the potential side effects of such medications underscore the increased need and preference for alternative therapies for pain management. The 2022 guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the Society for Integrative Oncology recommend using acupuncture and massage for oncologic pain management.

He acquired a photocopy of a government teacher\u2019s service book under this pretence. In collusion with Balbir Singh, Sidhu procured records from various departments, initiating complaints against individuals and extracting bribes to withdraw these complaints. In October last year, Sidhu was arrested by the Mohali police for allegedly assaulting deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Barinder Gill during an inquiry into Sidhu\u2019s disproportionate assets and criminal misconduct. The altercation occurred at the local vigilance office, where Sidhu was charged under several sections, including using criminal force to deter a public servant from discharging his duty and criminal intimidation. This case was registered at the Phase-8 police station following DSP Gill\u2019s complaint. In January 2024, Phase-8 police in Mohali booked Sidhu again for alleged extortion and graft.","img":"https:\/\/images.hindustantimes.com\/img\/2024\/08\/04\/550x309\/Police-arresting-the-accused-from-the-mediation-ce_1722709022486_1722740377051.jpg","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/cities\/chandigarh-news\/retired-aig-sidhu-not-new-to-controversies-101722709068668.html","url":"\/retired-aig-sidhu-not-new-to-controversies.html","category":"India, Haryana, Punjab","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2024-08-03T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"Kedarnath landslide: Uttarakhand govt sends fodder for stranded horses and mules","desc":"The Uttarakhand government's animal husbandry department on Saturday dispatched helicopters loaded with animal fodder for the mules and horses affected by the landslide in Kedarnath Valley following a cloudburst. The operation to rescue pilgrims trapped along the rain-ravaged trek route to the Himalayan Kedarnath shrine continued into its third day on Saturday. Officials said on Saturday that as many as 8,495 pilgrims stranded had been rescued so far after heavy rains damaged the route on Wednesday night. The rescue operation involves personnel from the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and the police. On Friday, the Indian Air Force's Chinook and MI17 helicopters airlifted several pilgrims from the area. According to the secretary of the Public Works Department, RK Sudhanshu, the rescue operation for those stranded in Kedarnath and along the Kedarnath route due to the heavy rains on July 31 is being conducted with utmost urgency. Pilgrims were stranded beyond Bhimbali on the Gaurikund-Kedarnath trek route after the swollen Mandakini river washed away a 20-25-metre section.

Iran, on the other hand, said that it expects Hezbollah to \u201chit deeper\u201d inside Israel and no longer be confined to military targets.

Ismail Haniyeh was killed on July 31 after he had attended the swearing-in of the new Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, in Tehran. The 62-year-old, who lived in Qatar, was the head of the political bureau of Hamas, which has governed the Gaza Strip since 2007.

The environment ministry clarified that the Centre did not grant environmental clearances for any developmental activities in Wayanad, except an in-principle nod for a Tube Unidirectional Tunnel Road (2+2 Lane) with Four Lane Approach (from existing roads) last year. The tunnel was envisioned to provide direct connectivity between Aanakampoyil Kalladi-Meppadi in Kozhikode and Wayanad districts of Kerala.

But the same time, he had a certain detachment to see the larger picture. Former Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Prakash Karat was one of many political leaders who were close to late West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. Here\u2019s what the Left leader had to say about the ex-CM. Just before the Emergency, in 1974, I had gone to Kolkata because our Student Federation of India\u2019s head office was there at that time. In the Youth Federation Office, I found a young man in his kurta-pajama sitting at a desk and writing away furiously. Years later, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee epitomised an era of communist politics in West Bengal, which has now ended with this passing away. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was as a person and a leader someone who touched various aspects of life and society in West Bengal. He was no ordinary communist cadre. He was also a person with literary accomplishments. And he had made a distinctive contribution to the development of cultural institutions and cultural life in West Bengal as well. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee the administrator the chief minister and long time minister of the left Front government-- that is of course the most well known and most public aspect of his political life. But for us, we were more or less on the same generation. We both came into the Central Committee of the party in 1985 so we saw him as the party cadre, a party organizer and a party leader who started this work in the student movement and then the youth movement and then he came into the leadership of the party in West Bengal as a state committee and state secretariat member. So what was so distinctive about him was his capacity to be totally devoted to his work. He was dedicated to what he has to do and the responsibilities assigned to him. But the same time, he had a certain detachment to see the larger picture. And as you know, he developed not just as a party functionary, but had active interest and passion for literature. He carried this tradition in West Bengal of being a Renaissance man. Personality, he represented everything that was progressive, democratic, secular in West Bengal and its cultural traditions. Within that framework, he was also a loyal party worker and a leader. He also tried to implement the party\u2019s understanding of how the Left front government should function with all the limitations of a state government.","img":"https:\/\/images.hindustantimes.com\/img\/2024\/08\/08\/550x309\/Former-West-Bengal-chief-minister-Buddhadeb-Bhatta_1723124643972.jpg","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/india-news\/buddhadeb-bhattacharjee-was-west-bengal-s-renaissance-man-prakash-karat-101723123992841.html","url":"\/buddhadeb-bhattacharjee-was-west-bengal-s-renaissance-man-prakash-karat.html","category":"India, West Bengal","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2024-08-07T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"Earthquake of magnitude 7.1 hits southern Japan, tsunami warning issued","desc":"The quake was centred off the eastern coast of Japan's southern main island of Kyushu at a depth of about 30 kilometres.

Gupta was last seen on August 4, prompting his wife to file a missing persons report at the Kodigehalli Police Station in Bengaluru.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was located by police after he activated a new SIM card in Noida, helping authorities trace his whereabouts,&nbsp;The Times of India&nbsp;reported. Initially, the police struggled to find him despite reviewing hundreds of CCTV feeds from bus stands, railway stations and the airport<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Wednesday, the techie bought a new SIM card in Noida and used it in his old phone, which allowed officers to track him down. The police approached him as he exited a mall, the report stated. According to a senior officer, &ldquo;When three of us surrounded him, he realised we were cops in civil clothes. He smiled and asked what next? We told him we should fly back to the city and he strongly objected.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>After several hours of persuasion, the techie reluctantly agreed to return with the officers, primarily to resolve the missing person report filed by his wife. &quot;You put me in prison, I will live there...but I won&#39;t return,&quot; Gupta told the officers repeatedly, as quoted in the publication.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The techie and the police arrived at the Kempegowda International Airport on Friday morning. After a brief rest, he gave a statement to the police and was allowed to go home. During questioning, he revealed that he has been facing severe domestic issues.

She curtails my freedom, she shouts even if a drop of rice or a piece of chapati falls off my plate. I should dress according to her, I cannot go out alone to enjoy tea,&rdquo; the techie told police.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>To avoid detection after his wife announced his disappearance online with pictures and videos, the techie had shaved his head and altered his appearance. He informed the police that he had travelled to Tirupati, Bhubaneswar, Delhi and finally Noida since August 4.<\/p>\r\n","img":"https:\/\/images.hindustantimes.com\/img\/2024\/08\/17\/550x309\/Screenshot_2024-08-17_114936_1723875656773_1723875693362.png","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/cities\/bengaluru-news\/put-me-in-prison-but-i-wont-return-techie-who-went-missing-from-bengaluru-reveals-domestic-struggles-report-101723873209733.html","url":"\/put-me-in-prison-but-i-wont-return-techie-who-went-missing-from-bengaluru-reveals-domestic-struggles.html","category":"India, Karnataka, Delhi","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2024-08-16T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"Governor has become a puppet: Siddaramaiah on prosecution sanction against him in MUDA case","desc":"<p>Karnataka chief minister&nbsp;Siddaramaiah&nbsp;on Saturday alleged that state governor had become a &ldquo;puppet&rdquo; in the hands of the central government and granting prosecution sanction against him is a sinister conspiracy to destabilise an elected government.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>His remarks came after governor Thaawarchand Gehlot granted permission to prosecute him based on a petition filed by advocate-activist T J Abraham, who alleged irregularities in the allotment of sites by&nbsp;MUDA.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The Honorable Governor has become a puppet in the hands of the Central Government, granting prosecution sanction against me is nothing but a sinister conspiracy to destabilize an elected government.

According to the&nbsp;South China Morning Post, A&#39;bao, who had been employed under a strict contract since February 2023, developed a severe pneumococcal infection that led to his death in June this year.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Chinese man&rsquo;s gruelling schedule<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A&#39;bao had agreed to work on a project in Zhoushan, a city in Zhejiang province, until January this year. His schedule was grueling, with him working daily from February to May and only taking a brief respite on April 6. On May 25, A&#39;bao fell ill and took a sick day, but his condition worsened rapidly. Three days later, his colleagues rushed him to the hospital where doctors diagnosed him with a lung infection and respiratory failure. Despite medical efforts, A&#39;bao died a few days later.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Family seeks justice<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Following A&#39;bao&#39;s death, his family filed a lawsuit against his employer for gross negligence. The case gained traction when social security officials controversially ruled that his death could not be classified as a work-related injury, citing the timing of his death as a key factor. The family argued that the relentless work schedule and lack of rest directly contributed to A&#39;bao&#39;s demise.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Employer&#39;s defense and legal ruling<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The company contended that A&#39;bao&#39;s workload was reasonable and that extra hours worked were voluntary. They also attributed his condition to pre-existing health issues and claimed he did not seek medical help promptly. However, the court ruled in favor of A&#39;bao&#39;s family, holding the employer 20% accountable for his death. The verdict highlighted that the prolonged work period was a clear breach of Chinese Labour Law, which limits work to 8 hours per day and 44 hours per week.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The court awarded A&#39;bao&#39;s family 400,000 yuan (approximately&nbsp;\u20b947,19,036) in compensation, including 10,000 yuan for emotional distress. Despite the company&#39;s appeal, the original verdict was upheld in August, marking a significant step in addressing overwork issues in China.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The case has sparked a broader discussion on labor practices and workers&#39; rights in China<\/p>\r\n","img":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/ht-img\/img\/2024\/09\/09\/550x309\/bv_d_1725883931390_1725883931685.jpg","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/trending\/chinese-man-30-dies-after-104-days-of-non-stop-work-with-only-1-day-off-101725882536101.html","url":"\/chinese-man-30-dies-after-104-days-of-non-stop-work-with-only-1-day-off.html","category":"World, India","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2024-09-08T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"Eye on peace, NSA to visit Moscow this week","desc":"<h2>NSA Ajit Doval will visit Moscow for BRICS talks on Ukraine, as Modi aims to facilitate peace discussions involving India and China.<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>After Russian President Vladimir Putin and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni publicly expressed that India and China can play a key role in resolving the Ukraine conflict, National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval will travel to Moscow on September 10-11 for the BRICS NSAs&rsquo; conference with an eye on brokering peace, people familiar with the matter said on Saturday.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi is said to have conveyed some ideas discussed with President Putin during his July visit to Russia when he met Ukraine&rsquo;s President Volodymyr Zelensky on his August visit to Kyiv. Modi in his remarks during a meeting with Putin on July 9 made it clear that peace cannot be found in battlefields and that loss of lives of children and innocent people in the Ukraine war was terrible. Doval accompanied the PM during the Russia and Ukraine visits<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>While some Modi and India baiters have claimed that the PM went to Ukraine on August 23 to balance foreign relations with western powers, the fact is that Zelensky had invited him to Ukraine during the 2021 Climate Change conference in Glasgow. Modi could not visit Kyiv earlier as the war broke out.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese NSA Wang Yi will also be present at the conference, with the Ukraine war top of the agenda. Doval and Wang Yi are also special representatives for talks on the India-China boundary resolution.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;India and the world want the war to end and in that context Modi is talking to all parties. He has no desire to be a mediator between Russia and Ukraine but supports all initiatives to stop the war so that children and women are not targeted by missiles, rockets and bullets,&rdquo; said a senior official.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telephonic conversations with US President Joe Biden and with Putin after Modi&rsquo;s visit to Ukraine should be seen in the context of war resolution and not as a balancing act, said the official cited above.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is understood that Modi discussed some &ldquo;special ideas&rdquo; with Zelensky in Kyiv and was totally unfazed by the vocal reaction of the Ukrainian President to the Indian media.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doval will meet his BRICS counterparts, including those from China and Brazil, to discuss how the grouping can support the no-war initiative and put an end to people&rsquo;s suffering. Already both President Putin and PM Meloni have urged India and China to play a role in conflict resolution, with Modi having close ties with leaders of Russia as well as Ukraine.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"google-ad\" id=\"google-ad-1\">\r\n<p>Google Ad 1<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n<p>India buys crude oil from Russia in order to keep domestic inflation in check and Moscow continues to be a major defence supplier to New Delhi. Ukraine also has significant military and bilateral cooperation with India.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Officials said Doval will also participate in a meeting of Brics-Plus high-level security officials. The meetings are being organised by Russia, current chair of Brics, ahead of the grouping&rsquo;s summit in Kazan in October. Doval is also expected to hold several bilateral meetings, including with his Russian counterpart Sergei Shoigu, people familiar with the matter said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meloni was the latest world leader to comment on the war, telling reporters after a meeting with Zelensky on Saturday that China and India &ldquo;can and must play a role&rdquo; in resolving the conflict.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zelensky had proposed after his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Kyiv on August 23 that India can host the second summit for peace in Ukraine, given its leading role in the Global South, provided New Delhi signs on to the joint communique issued after the first peace summit in Switzerland in June. India sent a senior official to the first summit but didn&rsquo;t endorse the joint communique, mainly because Russia wasn&rsquo;t part of the meeting.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last week, Putin said at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok that Brazil, China and India can be possible intermediaries for peace talks with Ukraine, since he has &ldquo;relations of trust and confidence&rdquo; with the leaders of these countries. Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the Izvestia daily the same day that India can help in establishing a dialogue on Ukraine.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The relationship between Putin and Modi &ldquo;allows for a line to be taken to obtain first-hand information from participants in the Ukrainian conflict&rdquo;, Peskov said. He added Modi &ldquo;communicates freely&rdquo; with Putin, Zelensky and the US and India has &ldquo;a very good chance of using its weight&rdquo; on the global stage and its &ldquo;influence to encourage the Americans and Ukrainians to take the peaceful path of settlement&rdquo;.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peskov, however, noted there were no specific plans about such an approach. &ldquo;There are no specific plans and it is unlikely that they could exist now, because... we do not see any preconditions for negotiations now,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>India has not publicly censured Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine and its leadership has consistently called for a return to the path of diplomacy and dialogue and a cessation of hostilities. Modi told Putin at their last meeting in July that talks can&rsquo;t succeed under the shadow of the gun and he told Zelensky last month that a solution to the conflict can&rsquo;t be found without engaging Russia.<\/p>\r\n","img":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/ht-img\/img\/2024\/09\/08\/550x309\/National-Security-Advisor--NSA--Ajit-Doval-calls-o_1725821537408.jpg","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/india-news\/eye-on-peace-nsa-to-visit-moscow-this-week-101725821586197.html","url":"\/eye-on-peace-nsa-to-visit-moscow-this-week.html","category":"World, Russia, India","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2024-09-08T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"Israel rescuers say over 60 wounded in area Hezbollah claimed drone strike","desc":"<p>An Israeli volunteer rescue service on Sunday said more than 60 people were wounded south of Haifa, where Hezbollah earlier claimed a drone strike that targeted a military base.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;With the help of United Hatzalah ambulance teams, we provided assistance to over 60 wounded people with varying degrees of injuries -- critical, serious, moderate and mild,&quot; the rescue service United Hatzalah said in a statement posted on its Facebook page.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier Sunday, Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which is at war with Israel, said it launched &quot;a squadron of attack drones&quot; at a military training camp in Binyamina, south of Haifa, in response to Israeli air strikes on the country.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The incident comes two days after air raid sirens sounded in central Israel after two aerial drones entered the country from Lebanon, with at least one building damaged north of Tel Aviv during the incident.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hezbollah has been regularly firing rockets and drones across the border into Israel for more than a year, but has reached further since late September when fighting escalated.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Israel&#39;s sophisticated air defences, including the Iron Dome system, has intercepted most of the projectiles, with few casualties caused by strikes or falling debris.<\/p>\r\n","img":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/ht-img\/img\/2024\/10\/13\/550x309\/ISRAEL-LEBANON-PALESTINIAN-CONFLICT-1_1728848692185_1728848732463.jpg","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/world-news\/israel-rescuers-say-over-60-wounded-in-area-hezbollah-claimed-drone-strike-101728848584129.html","url":"\/israel-rescuers-say-over-60-wounded-in-area-hezbollah-claimed-drone-strike.html","category":"World","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2024-10-13T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"Cocaine worth \u20b95,000 crore seized in Gujarat's Ankleshwar, third seizure in past 11 days","desc":"<p>The Delhi Police and Gujarat Police in a joint operation on Sunday seized 518 kilogrammes of cocaine worth&nbsp;\u20b95,000 crore in the western state&#39;s Ankleshwar, ANI report.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the report, cocaine was recovered during a search of Avkar Drugs Limited Company in Ankleshwar, Gujarat.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The drugs were hidden inside plastic packets of snacks with &#39;Tasty Treat&#39; and &#39;Chatpata Mixture&#39; written on them.

Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone&nbsp;disease&nbsp;wherein your new bone formation doesn&rsquo;t keep up with the loss of old bone. It results from loss of bone mass and mineralisation leading to fragile bones and sometimes fractures even with minor falls, therefore termed as fragility fractures.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Nitish Arora, Consultant Trauma, Limb Reconstruction, Deformity Correction and Pediatric Orthopedic Surgeon at Medicover Hospitals in Navi Mumbai, shared that risk factors for secondary osteoporosis can be classified into non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors -<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Non-modifiable risk factors include&nbsp;female gender, increasing age, early menopause, certain genetic factors, medications and certain medical conditions (for eg; prolonged steroid use, Rheumatoid Arthritis).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Modifiable risk factors include&nbsp;obesity, Lack of physical activities, inadequate peak bone mass, inadequate nutrition, unhealthy lifestyle which includes alcohol, obesity, excessive use of caffeine, prolonged use of over the counter antacids and steroids, all these factors can speed up the progression of osteoporosis.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Primary osteoporosis can be post menopausal (Type1) or Senile(age related) osteoporosis (type 2).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Do all the patients of osteoporosis have symptoms?<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Nitish Arora answered, &ldquo;It is usually a silent disease until complicated by a fracture. People with osteoporosis can have a stooped posture, loss of height, or a bone that breaks much more easily than expected. Sometimes they can present a severe back pain with a vertebral fracture without any history of fall.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Treatment of osteoporosis:<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Dr Nitish Arora, prevention is the only treatment but yes, if you have developed osteoporosis, you can consult your doctor to slow down the speed of progression of osteoporosis. Prevention can be started as early as possible when the child is growing up or it can be started even in the elderly (to prevent the speed of progression) in the form of -<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Attainment of higher peak bone mass and density: Regular exercises enhances your new bone formation, makes your muscle stronger, keeps your weight under control, maintains the balance and therefore prevents injury.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Adequate sunlight exposure and good nutrition which includes milk and milk based products, fox nuts, dry fruits, millets, ragi, eggs, oily fishes.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Usually vegetarians require regular Vitamin D supplements as Vitamin D is deficient in their diet.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Weight reduction: Obesity is one of the major risk factors for osteoporosis. It increases the mechanical loading on bone, decreases your Vit D absorption, releases certain factors in the body that predisposes the patient to develop osteoporosis.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Regular Calcium and Vit D supplements as advised by your physician.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Avoidance of alcohol, over consumption of caffeine and other unhealthy lifestyle habits.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Do not abuse antacid pills. Have it only when required.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Nitish Arora concluded, &ldquo;Once you have already developed osteoporosis or a a fracture because of osteoporosis, in addition to the precautions advised above, consult your doctor for anabolic medications (deposits new bone) or antiresorptive medications (prevents the loss of old bone) which can help you in slowing down the speed of progression.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n","img":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/ht-img\/img\/2024\/10\/19\/550x309\/World_Osteoporosis_Day_2024_1729344590220_1729344590453.jpg","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/lifestyle\/health\/world-osteoporosis-day-2024-everyday-habits-that-can-weaken-your-bone-health-expert-tips-for-stronger-bones-101729341825438.html","url":"\/world-osteoporosis-day-2024-everyday-habits-that-can-weaken-your-bone-health-expert-tips-for-stronger-bones.html","category":"Health","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2024-10-19T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"India announces breakthroughs in diagnosing tuberculosis and sickle cell anaemia patients","desc":"<p style=\"border:0px; display:block; height:0px; left:-9999px; margin-bottom:0; margin-left:0; margin-right:0; margin-top:0; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; padding:0px; position:absolute; top:0px; width:0px\">&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rajiv Bahl, Director General of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), at the 19th International Conference on Drug Regulatory Authorities (ICDRA) in India 2024, announced new projects and advances in public health.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He highlighted significant progress in TB diagnosis: a new portable X-ray unit developed for TB screening will improve early detection and treatment of the disease.

It is life-threatening and can be triggered by air pollution. With the rising&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/topic\/aqi\" target=\"_blank\">AQI&nbsp;<\/a>levels, especially in the states of Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and others, air pollution has become a pressing health concern. Pollutants in the air can affect each part of the body, from lungs to heart to skin.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr. Charulata Sankhla, Consultant Neurophysician. P. D. Hinduja Hospital &amp; Medical Research Centre, Mahim, said, &ldquo;Recent studies have shown serious consequences of air pollution on neurological disorders. Air pollution is responsible for one in five cases of deaths caused by stroke. It is also observed that air pollution is responsible for 30-83% of strokes across various studies.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Charulata Sankhla mentioned that there has been an increase in the number of deaths caused by air pollution-related strokes, especially in low- and middle-income countries. One of the primary causes of this is rapid industrialisation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How can air pollution cause hemorrhagic stroke?<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It is found that O3 found in air pollution triggers abnormal depositions in blood vessels of the brain leading to increased incidence of bleeds. It is also seen that increased PM diffuses into the blood from lungs giving rise to reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to thinning of arteries of the brain.

The programme&rsquo;s popularity is the key aspect of the Congress government&rsquo;s public outreach.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;But we will not stop the scheme at any cost. We will continue it,&rdquo; Reddy said on Saturday while acknowledging operational challenges but underscoring the government&rsquo;s determination to keep the scheme active.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said that the &ldquo;Shakti scheme&rdquo; is different from other state welfare programmes like the Ann Bhagya free rice initiative, which only serves those holding Below Poverty Line (BPL) cards and relies on Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT) to reach eligible beneficiaries.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;In contrast, the &lsquo;Shakti scheme&rsquo; provides universal access, allowing all women to travel free on road transport corporation (RTC) buses. This universal approach intensifies the strain on the transport department but remains a priority for the government. However, this scheme won&rsquo;t be stopped,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scheme recently drew attention after deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar&rsquo;s comments about potentially reviewing the programme. The opposition parties said that Shivakumar&rsquo;s remarks were an indication of possible cuts to the scheme. The Congress, in response, issued assurances that Shakti and other welfare programmes remained secure.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response to the controversy, Shivakumar clarified his earlier remarks on Friday, explaining that he never suggested discontinuing the scheme but was merely open to discussion based on feedback from the public. &ldquo;Whatever our elders say, we follow that,&rdquo; he said while dismissing the opposition&rsquo;s allegations. He added, &ldquo;The BJP just wants to do politics. They have nothing better to do.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He further explained that some working women, particularly those employed in the IT and multinational sectors, had expressed a willingness to contribute financially for bus travel, noting that they receive conveyance allowances. &ldquo;Several economically empowered women&hellip;have shown interest in paying for tickets. I only suggested that we discuss this with the Transport Minister, but I never implied discontinuing the scheme,&rdquo; Shivakumar said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Addressing Congress leaders in Karnataka, Mallikarjun Kharge on Thursday had advised caution to party workers on state&rsquo;s welfare commitments, particularly with elections in other states approaching. He noted that similar welfare initiatives were under consideration in Maharashtra and cautioned that terms like &ldquo;revision&rdquo; could easily be misconstrued.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, senior Congress member RV Deshpande, who leads the administrative reforms commission, supported Shivakumar&rsquo;s call for transparency in administering the scheme. Deshpande expressed concerns about potential misuse and argued for responsible management to ensure that benefits go only to those who need them. &ldquo;The guarantees will require&nbsp;\u20b965,000 crore every year. They&rsquo;re good programmes, but we see that they&rsquo;re being misused in some places,&rdquo; he noted, adding examples of women using the scheme for repeated, non-essential travel. &ldquo;Giving things free of cost&hellip; it&rsquo;s as good as it&rsquo;s dangerous,&rdquo; he commented.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deshpande suggested that transparency measures might help maintain a balance between resource allocation and benefits received, ensuring a fair distribution. &ldquo;We need to have transparency. There must be benefits only to the extent that one deserves. Steps in that direction aren&rsquo;t wrong, according to me,&rdquo; he added, acknowledging the need for accountability in implementing such large-scale welfare programs.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opposition parties, particularly the BJP, have criticised the Congress government, with Karnataka BJP chief BY Vijayendra saying that these schemes are straining state finances. He pointed to the ongoing costs associated with the Shakti scheme and other guarantees as factors slowing down Karnataka&rsquo;s development. &ldquo;Members of the ruling party themselves have repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with these guarantees, often calling for a re-evaluation,&rdquo; Vijayendra claimed, highlighting that the guarantees were introduced unprompted ahead of the 2023 Assembly elections.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vijayendra went further, suggesting that Congress&rsquo;s initiatives are responsible for economic challenges in Karnataka and have earned the state the label of a &ldquo;zero-development state.&rdquo; He argued that a lack of funds due to these welfare programs has delayed infrastructure development, with no new roads built or foundations laid recently. &ldquo;Their (Congress) guarantees are now straining the state&rsquo;s finances, earning Karnataka the label of a zero-development state,&rdquo; he remarked.<\/p>\r\n","img":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/ht-img\/img\/2024\/11\/03\/550x309\/The--Shakti-scheme--places-financial-stress-on-the_1730661595865_1730673489968.jpg","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/india-news\/shakti-scheme-putting-strain-on-government-but-won-t-halt-it-minister-101730661604639.html","url":"\/shakti-scheme-putting-strain-on-government-but-won-t-halt-it-minister.html","category":"India, Karnataka","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2024-11-03T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"\u2018Jai Shri Ram\u2019, 'Pak agenda\u2019 slogans raised as J&K assembly passes Article 370 resolution","desc":"<p>Ruckus ensued in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/topic\/jammu-and-kashmir\" target=\"_blank\">Jammu and Kashmir<\/a>&nbsp;assembly after the House passed a resolution seeking a restoration of Article 370 in the now Union territory.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a PTI report, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators tore copies of the document and raised slogans against the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/topic\/national-conference\" target=\"_blank\">National Conference<\/a>-led government in J&amp;K.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BJP MLAs raised slogans of &quot;August 5 Zindabad&quot;, &quot;Jai Shri Ram&quot;, &quot;Vande Mataram&quot;, &quot;Anti-national Agenda Nahi Chalega&quot;, &quot;Anti-Jammu Agenda Nahi Chalega&quot;, &quot;Pakistani Agenda Nahin Chalega&quot;, and &quot;Speaker Hai Hai&quot; leading to frequent disruptions of the proceedings resulting in adjournment of the House.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Conference and BJP traded barbs against each other during the proceedings.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leader of opposition Sunil Sharma accused the Speaker of being partisan,&quot;We have reports that you (speaker) called a meeting of ministers yesterday and drafted the resolution yourself.&quot;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another BJP MLA, Sham Lal Sharma, said the resolution was prepared &quot;in collusion with the speaker in a guest house&quot;.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The mandate (of the Assembly polls) was in favour of abrogation of Article 370 because we (BJP) got 26 per cent votes against NC&#39;s 23 per cent.

India has run up a trade deficit of almost $57 billion with Russia, largely due to massive purchases of Russian crude since 2022. In July, the two sides set a target of ramping up trade to $100 billion by 2030.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>India is confident about achieving this trade target well before 2030, Jaishankar said in his opening remarks at the meeting of the Intergovernmental Commission on Trade, Economic, Scientific, Technical and Cultural Cooperation (IGC-TEC) as the two economies are complementary and benefit from &ldquo;trust and confidence built over many years&rdquo;.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>While growth in bilateral trade, currently estimated at $66 billion, is impressive, the two sides have some way to go in tackling challenges, Jaishankar said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Our goal is that [trade] needs to be more balanced and that will require addressing current constraints and undertaking greater facilitative efforts. Making it easier to do trade should be accompanied by progress in negotiations on the India-Eurasian Economic Union FTA,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;There have been challenges to trade, especially in regard to payments and logistics.

He said two-way trade has grown more than five-fold in the past five years and India is now Russia&rsquo;s second largest trade partner. In addition to procuring agricultural products from India, Russia is also importing industrial equipment, components, and pharmaceutical drugs, he said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further expansion of the trade basket and reducing the trade imbalance will be part of the programme for economic cooperation till 2030, and Russia is strongly committed to the signing of an FTA between India and the Eurasian Economic Union, as well as a bilateral agreement on services and investments, Manturov said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The settlement of trade in local and alternative currencies is now approaching 90%, and it&rsquo;s necessary to continue expanding relations between Indian and Russian banks, he said.

Nothing more, nothing less. If you look at our current situation with China, we have an issue where our troops are uncomfortably close along the Line of Actual Control, which required us to disengage,&rdquo; Jaishankar said while responding to a question on whether the disengagement amounted to the start of a strategic reset.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The understanding between India and China on October 21 was the last of the disengagement agreements. &ldquo;So that with its implementation, the disengagement part of the problem is at rest,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;After this, there is the de-escalation, which means the massing of troops along the LAC and all the associated developments with that. And linked with that, the other aspects of the relationship. So, at this moment, frankly we are focused on the disengagement.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the disengagement, he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a reasonable supposition that there will be some improvement in the ties&rdquo;. Asked if this was cause for optimism, he replied: &ldquo;Perhaps the current situation doesn&rsquo;t necessarily warrant that at this time.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>India and China reached an agreement on patrolling arrangements at the two &ldquo;friction points&rdquo; of Demchok and Depsang on the LAC on October 21, paving the way for the resolution of the military standoff in Ladakh sector that began in April-May 2020. The face-off and a brutal clash at Galway Valley that killed 20 Indian soldiers and at least four Chinese troops took bilateral ties to an all-time low. two days after the agreement, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping met for the first time in five years on the margins of the Brics Summit in Russia and decided to revive other mechanisms to address the border issue.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Responding to another question on whether the economic and security arms of the government have differing views on China in the context of the Economic Survey 2024 that called for greater economic engagement with Beijing, Jaishankar said different ministries could have varying points of view.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think an accurate way of looking at it is that in every government, different ministries have different responsibilities, and flowing from that responsibility, they have a point of view. You refer to an Economic Survey. In effect, there would be a national security survey which you may not see in public, which would have a national security point of view,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The external affairs ministry is &ldquo;an integrator of all points of views&rdquo; and takes an overall balanced approach. &ldquo;If somebody has a point of view, then we look at that point of view. We don&rsquo;t say you can&rsquo;t have that point of view, but a point of view at the end of the day is not a policy decision,&rdquo; he added.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>India and China, both countries with large populations and a civilisational history, are on the upswing, he said. They are also located next to each other, which makes the management of changes more complex. &ldquo;So how do you get a sort of equilibrium or a stability when two big countries are changing so profoundly next to each other?&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said this is not easy since India and China&rsquo;s societies, politics, economics and mindsets are very different. &ldquo;You have to factor all this in, in making an approach and that is why it&rsquo;s such a complicated relationship,&rdquo; he added.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jaishankar said Donald Trump had emerged victorious in the US presidential election because of concerns among Americans that the current form of globalisation has not served their interests and made them less secure. There is also rethinking about the US&rsquo;s terms of engagement with the world and the era when the US felt it was empowered to take care of every global problem could be over, he said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Trump is seeking to reset the terms of engagement with other countries, this doesn&rsquo;t mean he is &ldquo;turning his back on the world&rdquo;, Jaishankar said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s telling the world that there&rsquo;s a different deal on offer, that your access to the American economy, your expectation of American resources and activities, the cost to America, all these will change,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s feasible...that America would turn its back on the world...If you are the number one power, you have to remain engaged with the world, but the terms you are offering to the world are going to be different from the terms which were there,&rdquo; he added.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the US will still need global partners in fields such as manufacturing, technology and national security since it cannot do everything by itself, Jaishankar said. In this context, he said the India-US initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET) and reworking of supply chains and engineering of new digital chains are unlikely to be affected by the change of government in the US, he said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The logic of iCET is, in different domains of high sensitivity, to forge partnerships between countries, governments and societies which have a higher level of trust, where you actually relate to each other...I think we&rsquo;re going to see that as a structural trend and, my own sense is, if President Trump is determined to make America more competitive and brings to it a strong element of business viability, I think such an America will actually look for partners with whom it can work in a complementary fashion,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Responding to a question on the role India can play in the resolution of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Jaishankar said it had become very clear that a solution won&rsquo;t be found on the battlefield.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What are the choices? One is to stay on the sidelines and say, &lsquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t concern me.&rsquo; The other is to give broad homilies and leave it at that. A third one is to back one side or the other, which some countries are doing. And maybe a fourth one is to say, &lsquo;Ok, let me apply myself to this tragic situation. Let me try to do something about it. Maybe it will work. Maybe it will not,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He pointed out there were very few countries or leaders with the ability to speak to both warring sides, and that Modi had met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in June, August and September, and with Russian President Vladimir Putin in July and October.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What we have been trying to do is to have conversations, in good faith, with the understanding that common points or convergences in those conversations, if the other party was comfortable, we were prepared to share it with the other side,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We have not put forward a peace plan. We don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s our business to do that. Our business is to try to find a way of bringing these two countries to a point where they are able to engage, because, at the end of the day, they have to engage with each other. Others cannot solve the problem if they are not willing to solve it.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n","img":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/ht-img\/img\/2024\/11\/16\/550x309\/External-affairs-minister-S-Jaishankar-said-India-_1731751505236.jpg","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/india-news\/htls-2024-jaishankar-says-lac-disengagement-must-lead-to-deescalation-101731745452500.html","url":"\/htls-2024-jaishankar-says-lac-disengagement-must-lead-to-deescalation.html","category":"World, India, China","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2024-11-16T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"Haryana students learn to make bomb from YouTube, detonate under teacher's chair","desc":"<p>A group of class 12 students were suspended from their school after they allegedly detonated a firecracker-like bomb under the chair of their female science teacher as part of a prank.

It is in our DNA, our vision, and in our conduct,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his address, Modi highlighted India&rsquo;s role as a first responder and its propensity to reach out to help any country facing a crisis, be it conflict situations, natural disasters or the help extended to more than 150 nations during the Covid-19 pandemic by supplying them with vaccines and medicines.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;After the pandemic, we had to move towards a new world order, but the world got entangled in other things. In these circumstances, the world must move ahead with the mantra &lsquo;democracy first, humanity first&rsquo;.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said it was critical for the world to deal with challenges including terrorism drugs and cybercrimes for the bright future of the coming generations. &ldquo;This is possible only if the mantra of &lsquo;democracy first, humanity first&rsquo; takes centrestage.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Modi said a united voice of the Global South is crucial. &ldquo;This is the time for the awakening of the Global South,&rdquo; he said, adding that India&rsquo;s mantra of &lsquo;humanity first&rsquo; inspires it to amplify the voice of the Global South, including at the recent G-20 Summit in Brazil.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also said women will play a pivotal role in ensuring global prosperity in the 21st century, highlighting how India made women-led development a big agenda during its G-20 presidency last year.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He called for greater exchanges between India and Guyana in the fields of education and innovation so that the potential of the youth can be fully realised. Underscoring India&rsquo;s deep commitment to further strengthening India-Guyana ties, he said that Guyana could become the bridge of opportunities between India and the Latin American continent.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conveying India&rsquo;s steadfast support to the Caribbean region, he thanked Guyana President Mohamed Irfaan Ali for hosting the 2nd India-Caricom Summit.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking at the summit on Wednesday, Modi said India plans to deepen its cooperation with Caricom (Caribbean Community) countries, with focus on seven key areas including capacity building, agriculture and food security, renewable energy and climate change, innovation, technology and trade, cricket and culture, ocean economy and maritime security, and medicine and healthcare.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The seven areas identified by Modi form the acronym Caricom, a style associated with the PM. Caricom is a grouping of 21 countries including 15 member states and six associate members.<\/p>\r\n","img":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/ht-img\/img\/2024\/11\/21\/550x309\/India-s-Prime-Minister-Narendra-Modi-waves-as-he-a_1732214179267_1732216928409.jpg","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/india-news\/democracy-first-humanity-first-pm-at-guyana-house-101732214246257.html","url":"\/democracy-first-humanity-first-pm-at-guyana-house.html","category":"World, India, Guyana","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2024-11-21T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"Gautam Adani indicted: White House reacts, \u2018confident\u2019 in navigating crisis","desc":"<p>The White House said it is aware of the allegations against Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, chairman of Adani Group, who was indicted in New York over his role in an alleged multibillion-dollar bribery and fraud scheme.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>US prosecutors said&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/topic\/gautam-adani\" target=\"_blank\">Gautam Adani<\/a>&nbsp;and seven other defendants, including his nephew Sagar Adani, agreed to pay about $265 million in bribes to Indian government officials to obtain contracts expected to yield $2 billion of profit over 20 years, and develop India&#39;s largest solar power plant project.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/business\/adani-group-reacts-to-us-indictment-against-gautam-adani-baseless-101732175433336.html\" target=\"_blank\">Adani Group denied the allegations as &ldquo;baseless&rdquo;,&nbsp;<\/a>while Indian government officials haven&#39;t commented so far.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>During a media briefing on Thursday,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/topic\/white-house\" target=\"_blank\">White House<\/a>&nbsp;press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that the administration is aware of the charges against Adani.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asserting that the relationship between India and the US is built on a strong foundation, the White House spokesperson has expressed confidence that the US can navigate the ongoing crisis surrounding bribery charges against Gautam Adani.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Obviously, we&#39;re aware of these allegations, and I would have to refer you to the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) and DOJ (Department of Justice) about the specifics of those allegations against the Adani Group,&rdquo; Karine Jean-Pierre said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What I will say is on the US and India relationship, we believe that it stands on an extremely strong foundation anchored in ties between our people and cooperation across a full range of global issues,&rdquo; Jean-Pierre added.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Advocating strong India-US ties, the White House press secretary said, &ldquo;What we believe and we are confident about is that we&#39;ll continue to navigate this issue as we have with other issues that may have come up as you just stated.

It&#39;s a paltry sum,&rdquo; says Chandni Raina, an adviser to India&rsquo;s department of economic affairs. Representing India at the summit, Raina expressed strong disapproval of both the finance package and the process by which it was adopted. &ldquo;This document is little more than an optical illusion. This, in our opinion, will not address the enormity of the challenge we all face. Therefore, we oppose the adoption of this document.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>India&rsquo;s rejection of the climate finance package came in the face of celebration by developed nations who hailed the deal as a significant milestone. The European Union (EU)&rsquo;s climate envoy, Wopke Hoekstra, said, &ldquo;COP29 will be remembered as the start of a new era on climate finance. The EU will continue to lead. This COP delivered an ambitious and realistic goal and an increased contributor base. With these funds and this structure, we are confident we&rsquo;ll reach the $1.3 trillion.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>For India, however, the package is emblematic of deeper inequities in global climate action. &ldquo;$300 billion does not address the needs and priorities of developing countries,&rdquo; Raina argued. &ldquo;It is incompatible with the principle of CBDR (Common but Differentiated Responsibilities) and equity.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final hours of COP29 were marked by heated negotiations, backroom deals, and accusations of procedural unfairness. The presidency of the summit, led by Azerbaijan, was accused of rushing the adoption of the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) without adequately consulting all parties. &ldquo;We had informed the presidency and the secretariat that we wanted to make a statement before any decision on the adoption,&rdquo; Raina said. &ldquo;However, and this is for everyone to see, this has been stage-managed, and we are extremely disappointed with this incident.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This sentiment was echoed by other members of the Global South. Delegations from small island states and the least developed countries (LDCs) bloc walked out of one meeting, stating that their concerns were being ignored. Civil society organizations also criticized the outcome. Harjeet Singh, Global Engagement Director of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, called the deal &ldquo;woefully inadequate.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;The deal fails to provide the critical support required for developing countries to transition swiftly from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy systems or to prepare for the devastating impacts of the climate crisis, leaving them severely under-resourced.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>India&rsquo;s resistance to the package is not merely a refusal to compromise but a clarion call for transformative change. The $300 billion figure, though a step up from previous pledges, is seen as disproportionately small compared to the scale of the crisis. Furthermore, it shifts responsibility onto all actors, including private entities and even developing nations themselves, through voluntary contributions. This, India argues, undermines the historical responsibility of developed nations, who bear the brunt of accountability for the climate crisis.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>India&rsquo;s opposition to the COP29 outcome is further accentuated by its impressive track record in climate action. As the only G20 nation on track to achieve its Paris Agreement goals, India has proven that sustainable development and rapid economic growth can coexist. Its ambitious renewable energy targets, including 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030, are testament to its commitment.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>India&rsquo;s leadership in global initiatives like the International Solar Alliance (ISA) has catalysed the adoption of solar energy worldwide, particularly in countries lacking resources for clean energy transitions. Domestically, India has championed green technologies, from scaling up electric mobility under the National Electric Mobility Mission to investing in green hydrogen as a future energy source. Programmes like Perform, Achieve, Trade (PAT) have improved energy efficiency in industries, while policies promoting urban climate resilience offer scalable solutions for other nations.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>By showcasing these achievements, India positions itself as a leader in the Global South, demonstrating that ambitious climate action is achievable even in resource-constrained settings. This credibility strengthens India&rsquo;s call for equitable climate finance and the fulfilment of commitments made by developed countries.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>India&rsquo;s rejection of the COP29 deal signals a need for a fundamental rethinking of the global climate finance framework. The $300 billion pledge falls short not only in scale but also in timing, with the funds slated to flow only by 2035 which is long after many developing nations will have faced irreversible climate impacts. The Global South has argued for a binding commitment of $1.3 trillion annually by 2030, a figure necessary to ensure a just transition to low-carbon pathways and build resilience against climate shocks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A reimagined framework must include simplified mechanisms to access climate finance, particularly for the most vulnerable nations. The current process is marred by bureaucratic hurdles, delaying the delivery of resources to those in urgent need. Moreover, developed nations must shift away from offering loans disguised as climate finance, which exacerbates the debt burdens of developing countries.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>India&rsquo;s stance at COP29 also highlights the importance of technology transfer and capacity-building. Beyond financial resources, developing nations require access to affordable technologies that enable them to achieve their climate goals. India has already taken steps in this direction, leading initiatives like the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) and advancing South-South cooperation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>India&rsquo;s rejection of the COP29 package is not merely a protest against an inadequate financial pledge, it is a call to action for a more equitable and ambitious global climate regime. During the plenary session Raina asserted that only trust and collaboration can drive meaningful action against climate change, which is one of humanity&rsquo;s greatest existential challenges.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a leader among developing nations, India has the capacity to shape the climate agenda in several ways. Strengthening alliances within the Global South can amplify demands for fair and just financing mechanisms. Collaborating with nations like Nigeria, Bolivia, and Malawi, which supported India at COP29, can create a unified front to hold developed nations accountable.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Domestically, India must continue to lead by example, exceeding its climate goals and implementing innovative solutions. Its achievements in renewable energy deployment, sustainable urban development, and industrial efficiency can serve as models for other nations. India can champion new financial instruments, such as green bonds and blended finance models, to mobilise resources without compromising equity.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>India&rsquo;s firm stance at COP29 is a pivotal moment in global climate diplomacy. By rejecting an inadequate climate finance package, India has reaffirmed its commitment to a fair and just transition for the Global South. Its leadership, rooted in both domestic achievements and a vision for global equity, can help redefine the narrative around climate action.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The path forward must prioritise trust, collaboration, and ambition. India&rsquo;s role as a leader is not merely aspirational; it is grounded in its successes and its unwavering commitment to justice. As Raina eloquently stated, &ldquo;We absolutely object to this unfair means of adoption. We are faced with one of the biggest challenges of all times which will determine our existence. The only thing that enables us to move beyond and take action in line with addressing this challenge is collaboration and trust among us. It is a fact that both have not worked today. We are extremely hurt by this action of the presidency and the UNFCCC Secretariat&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>India&rsquo;s voice at COP29 echoes the demands of billions across the Global South: a call for equity, accountability, and meaningful action. By continuing to lead with both advocacy and example, India can help shape a future where climate action is not just a promise but a shared reality.<\/p>\r\n","img":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/ht-img\/img\/2024\/11\/26\/550x309\/A-view-shows-a-venue-of-the-COP29-United-Nations-c_1732215321964_1732608055942.jpg","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/ht-insight\/climate-change\/indias-stand-against-inadequate-climate-finance-at-cop29-101732607992344.html","url":"\/indias-stand-against-inadequate-climate-finance-at-cop29.html","category":"World, India, Azerbaijan","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2024-11-26T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"India suggests funding proposal for plastic phase-out","desc":"<p>India has circulated a proposal for the financial arrangement to implement a global legally binding instrument on phasing out plastic pollution, currently being negotiated in South Korea&rsquo;s Busan where the fifth session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment (INC-5) is being held .<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>India&rsquo;s proposal suggests that parties under the agreement, shall establish a mechanism for providing financial and technical assistance, including the transfer of technologies to developing countries from developed countries. This is for achieving a &ldquo;just transition&rdquo; towards sustainable production and consumption of plastics.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mechanism is to enable their compliance with control measures as specified under the treaty. The compliance, by developing countries with respect to control measures shall be linked to provision of the incremental cost as assessed by the Subsidiary Body under the treaty, the proposal seen by HT states.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This proposed mechanism will include a new dedicated multilateral fund. It may also include other means of multilateral, regional and bilateral co-operation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Countries are expected to agree on an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in seas and oceans by end of this week.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>INC Chair Luis Vayas circulated a non-paper in late October this year that captures common ground among INC members on which they are likely to agree to.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This non-paper has a preamble which lists the reasons for phasing out plastics. It also lists exemptions that may be allowed. And it discusses plastic product design, supply (this is to do with managing the supply of primary polymers to achieve sustainable levels of production and consumption), emissions, plastic waste management, just transition, finance to aid transition, and implementation and monitoring.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chair Luis Vayas clarified on Monday that the Non-Paper is entirely bracketed (which means every aspect is up for discussion) , and has been proposed as a &ldquo;starting point for negotiations&rdquo;.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This session is a pivotal opportunity to deal with one of the most pressing global environmental problems. Plastic waste is about 80% of all marine pollution, with an estimate of 8 to 10 million MT entering oceans annually. Plastic production soared from 2.3 million tonnes in 1950 to 448 million tonnes 2015. The economic and environmental costs of this are profound. Microplastics impact human organs and are associated with serious health risks including cancers,&rdquo; said Vayas during a press conference on Monday.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The world is producing twice as much plastic waste as two decades ago, with the bulk of it ending up in landfill, incinerated or leaking into the environment, and only 9% successfully recycled, according to a 2022 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report. Almost half of all plastic waste is generated in OECD countries, according to the Outlook. Plastic waste generated annually per person varies from 221 kg in the United States and 114 kg in European OECD countries to 69 kg, on average, for Japan and Korea. Most plastic pollution comes from inadequate collection and disposal of larger plastic debris known as macroplastics, but leakage of microplastics (synthetic polymers smaller than 5 mm in diameter) from things like industrial plastic pellets, synthetic textiles, road markings and tyre wear are also a serious concern.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than 99% of plastic is made from fossil fuels. If plastic&rsquo;s life cycle were a country, it would be the fifth largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world. If plastic production continues as planned, by 2050 the accumulation of greenhouse gas emissions from plastic could use 10-13% of our entire remaining carbon budget, according to Break Free From Plastic.<\/p>\r\n","img":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/ht-img\/img\/2024\/11\/26\/550x309\/India-s-proposal-suggests-that-parties-under-the-a_1732644693219.jpg","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/india-news\/india-suggests-funding-proposal-for-plastic-phaseout-101732644700518.html","url":"\/india-suggests-funding-proposal-for-plastic-phaseout.html","category":"World, India","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2024-11-26T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"'Extremely worrying': Priyanka Gandhi reacts to ISKCON Bangladesh priest Chinmoy Krishna Das's arrest","desc":"<p>Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Wednesday reacted to the arrest of ISKCON priest Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari in Bangladesh, saying the incident was &quot;extremely worrying&quot; and the BJP-led central government must intervene.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The news of the arrest of the priest of ISKCON Temple in Bangladesh and the continuing violence against minority Hindus are extremely worrying,&quot; she wrote on X.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>She demanded that the central government strongly raise the issue of the safety of minorities in Bangladesh.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I appeal to the Central Government to intervene in this matter and strongly raise the issue of ensuring the safety of minorities before the Bangladesh Government,&quot; she said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinmoy Krishna Das was arrested on Monday and presented before a Chittagong court on Tuesday.

The prime reason is unpredictable variations in climate and seasonal yields, coupled with extreme price tags.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the last decade, the tomato farmers had seen the best of their fortunes and the worst as well. They express optimism regarding their prospects in 2025, buoyed by expectations of favorable weather conditions and improved market dynamics.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nearly two-thirds of the Madanapalle division is dedicated to tomato cultivation across a vast area of about 25,000 hectares, contributing its might to the State&rsquo;s agricultural productivity and remaining the leader of tomato trade in India.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tomato market in Madanapalle is subject to significant price fluctuations driven by several variables. Adverse weather, including heavy rainfall and prolonged summers, can profoundly impact crop yields, while disruptions in supply chains and seasonal variations in demand heighten price instability. All these factors have impacted tomato cultivation in 2024. Statistics for the last decade show that during peak harvesting periods, prices for tomatoes in the wholesale market can drop as low as \u20b94 per kilogram, whereas off-season shortages or crop damage can propel prices beyond \u20b990 per kilogram.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In October 2024, wholesale tomato prices surged to \u20b990 per kilogram due to heavy rainfall in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka, which caused extensive crop destruction and supply chain interruptions. All over South India, the retail prices even exceeded \u20b9100 per kilogram, thereby imposing a financial burden on consumers and small retailers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the first week of January 2025, the average wholesale price of tomatoes in Madanapalle stood at \u20b912 per kg.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quantifying the annual revenue generated by the Madanapalle tomato market presents many challenges. The areas of Punganur and Palamaner in Chittoor district and the Madanapalle division in Annamayya district produced an impressive 12 lakh metric tonnes of tomatoes during the 2020-21 agricultural season, demonstrating the region&rsquo;s agricultural capacity. However, the sudden surge of tomato cultivation revolution between 2021-2024 in other States &mdash; Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, and Karnataka &mdash; led to a sharp decline in the exports from the Madanapalle region, endangering its monopoly.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Price volatility represents a primary concern, as sudden market changes often erode profit margins. The elevated costs associated with agrochemicals and pest management further strain farmers&rsquo; finances, and limited negotiating power frequently results in inadequate compensation for their produce.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts propose that implementing strategic initiatives could alleviate these challenges and leverage the market&rsquo;s potential. The establishment of food processing industries could utilize surplus supply during peak harvest periods, thereby minimizing waste and stabilizing prices.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The promotion of contract farming could secure markets for farmers, ensuring stable income. Additionally, the development of organized marketing systems would provide farmers with enhanced opportunities and improved profitability,&rdquo; Mr. Srikanth, a Chennai-based horticultural scientist who works in the Rayalaseema region, observed.<\/p>\r\n","img":"https:\/\/th-i.thgim.com\/public\/incoming\/7566bn\/article69061302.ece\/alternates\/LANDSCAPE_1200\/Tomato%2001.jpg","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/news\/national\/andhra-pradesh\/changing-landscape-of-tomato-trade-in-madanapalle-of-ap\/article69061108.ece","url":"\/changing-landscape-of-tomato-trade-in-madanapalle-of-ap.html","category":"Andhra Pradesh","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2025-01-05T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"Nag Mark 2 aces field trial: Top 5 insights from India's anti-tank missile","desc":"<p>The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) on Monday successfully conducted field evaluation trials of India&#39;s indigenous Anti-Tank Missile - Nag Mark 2 at the Pokhran Field Range in Rajasthan.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nag Mark-2 is the third-generation Anti-Tank Fire-and-Forget Guided Missile which was fielded in the presence of senior officers of the Indian Army.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nag Missile Carrier version-2 was also field evaluated.

Increased demand, regulation changes, and visa retrogression put pressure on the need to act fast to gain permanent residency in the United States.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Here&#39;s why acting now is crucial and how investors can achieve the American dream-<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Visa retrogression occurs when demand for visas in a category exceeds supply, causing delays for applicants. The January 2025 Visa Bulletin cautions on possible backlogs in the new rural and High Unemployment Area (HUA) set aside category. Those applicants that have the cut-off date would have longer waits, and such investors need to file early in order to lock a priority date.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Investors do not have access to interim benefits like Employment Authorization Documents (EAD) or Advance Parole (AP), until concurrent filing is filed. Under the Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) as well, dependent children&#39;s ages are frozen at the time their Adjustment of Status (AOS) is filed. Children who will be turning 21 may &lsquo;age out&rsquo; due to retrogression delays.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prior to the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022 which set aside categories to rural, high unemployment and infrastructure, 32% of visas had been allocated to EB-5 projects. However, demand has surged. A top of this, approximately 7,000 I-526E petitions were filed between April 2022 and July 2024, creating fierce competition.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Visa expert cites How staggered investments and early filings are game-changers<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Retrogression is unpredictable, and securing a priority date early protects investors from being caught in a visa backlog,&rdquo; says Nicholas Mastroianni III, President of the US Immigration Fund, told&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">HindustanTimes.com<\/a>. &ldquo;With staggered investment, investors can file their I-526E with just $200,000 initially. This secures their priority date&mdash;which is crucial for avoiding retrogression&mdash;and gives them up to six months to fund the remaining $600,000.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He then advised, &ldquo;The Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS) reset in April 2025 presents a significant opportunity for Indian investors. Right now, Indian nationals can remit up to $250,000 per person per financial year, but with the 20% Tax Collected at Source (TCS), it can become financially restrictive,&rdquo; and added, &ldquo;The smart play here is to leverage a staggered investment approach. At USIF, we&rsquo;ve structured programs that allow investors to start their EB-5 process by filing an I-526E petition with an initial investment of just $200,000. This locks in their priority date&mdash;which is crucial for beating retrogression&mdash;while giving them up to six months to fund the remaining $600,000.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Concurrent filing has been a game-changer for EB-5 investors already in the U.S. on H-1B, F-1, or other non-immigrant visas. In the past, investors had to wait for their I-526 petition to be approved before filing for Adjustment of Status (AOS). That meant long periods of uncertainty.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>While addressing the Child Status Protection Act (CSPA), &ldquo;CSPA protection only kicks in if the investor files for AOS within one year of visa availability. If the child turns 21 during that waiting period and no action is taken, they could age out.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The best thing investors can do is file early. By submitting the I-526E petition well before the child approaches 21, investors extend the pending period, lowering the risk. Concurrent filing is another safeguard, as it freezes the child&#39;s age immediately.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n","img":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/ht-img\/img\/2025\/01\/14\/550x309\/download_1711564654758_1736880938377.png","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/world-news\/us-news\/indian-investors-must-act-now-to-secure-their-eb5-visa-before-trump-2-0-kicks-in-heres-how-they-can-101736878996015.html","url":"\/indian-investors-must-act-now-to-secure-their-eb5-visa-before-trump-2-0-kicks-in.html","category":"World, United States, India","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2025-01-14T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"US Buying Greenland Takes Official Turn, Trump To Get Powers To Negotiate","desc":"<p>Make Greenland Great Again Act: The bill titled &#39;Make Greenland Great Again Act&#39; is being circulated to gather co-sponsors for it.

She claimed he then sexually assaulted her.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article claims all of the accusers had been willing to engage with Gaiman&rsquo;s requests to some extent by calling him &ldquo;master,&quot; but the women allege that consent and specific BDSM activities, which they say took place, had not been discussed and agreed on before they happened.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gaiman&rsquo;s representatives had previously told Tortoise Media that &ldquo;sexual degradation, bondage, domination, sadism and masochism may not be to everyone&rsquo;s taste, but between consenting adults, BDSM is lawful&rdquo;. A police report accusing Gaiman of sexual assault was made in January 2023, but the investigation was eventually dropped.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gaiman is known for books such as Coraline, American Gods and The Sandman, all of which have been adapted for the cinema or television.

This groundbreaking research, led by Gaurav Chaudhary from the University of Cambridge and Ivar Martin from Argonne National Laboratory, reveals how specific structural features in these materials enhance electron interactions. The implications of these findings could lead to the development of new superconducting devices and innovative applications in condensed matter physics.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Understanding Sliding Ferroelectricity and Polarisation Reversal<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent studies have highlighted the phenomenon of sliding ferroelectricity in certain two-dimensional van der Waals materials, such as boron nitride and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). This unique property allows for polarisation reversal when moderate electric fields are applied. The ability to manipulate layer stacking on a large scale significantly alters the electronic properties of these materials.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Researchers have identified domain walls as critical components in this process. These walls serve as boundaries that separate regions with different orientations of ferroelectric polarisation. They exhibit unique characteristics that enhance electron-phonon coupling, which is essential for various electronic applications. The manipulation of these domain walls can lead to significant advancements in material science, particularly in the development of devices that require precise control over their electronic properties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The implications of sliding ferroelectricity extend beyond basic research. They offer potential pathways for creating advanced materials that can be tailored for specific applications. As scientists continue to explore these properties, the understanding of how ferroelectricity interacts with other phenomena, such as superconductivity, will deepen, paving the way for innovative technological solutions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Superconductivity Observed at Domain Walls<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The research team discovered that superconductivity is transiently enhanced near ferroelectric reversal transitions in materials like molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe\u2082). This enhancement occurs within hysteresis loops, where domains of varying polarisation coexist. The dynamic fluctuations in these domain walls are identified as the driving mechanism for the pairing interactions necessary for superconductivity.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This phenomenon is particularly intriguing because it is exclusive to two-dimensional TMDs. These materials support interlayer ferroelectricity while maintaining conductivity within their planes. The unique characteristics of the domain walls in these materials create conditions that are conducive to superconductivity, offering a new perspective on how these properties can be harnessed.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Understanding the relationship between ferroelectricity and superconductivity could lead to the development of new materials with enhanced performance. Researchers are excited about the potential applications of these findings, as they could revolutionize the field of superconducting devices. The ability to control superconductivity through structural manipulation opens up new avenues for research and technology.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Future Research and Applications<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Chaudhary and Martin believe their findings could lead to the creation of highly controllable superconducting devices. They are currently exploring the systematic design of new superconductors by layering polar materials and utilizing domain wall networks in moir&eacute; systems. This approach could significantly enhance the performance and applicability of superconducting materials.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further investigations are essential to validate their theoretical models. Advanced microscopic simulations will play a crucial role in this process. By refining their understanding of the interactions between ferroelectricity and superconductivity, researchers hope to uncover unconventional mechanisms that could lead to new breakthroughs.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study has sparked interest among scientists eager to explore the properties of two-dimensional materials. As research progresses, the potential for innovative applications in electronics and materials science becomes increasingly promising. This work marks an important step forward in the quest to harness the unique properties of 2D materials for practical use, paving the way for future advancements in technology.<\/p>\r\n","img":"https:\/\/observervoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/Breakthrough-in-Superconductivity-and-Ferroelectricity.jpg.avif","redirect_url":"https:\/\/observervoice.com\/breakthrough-in-superconductivity-and-ferroelectricity-87951\/","url":"\/breakthrough-in-superconductivity-and-ferroelectricity.html","category":"Science","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2025-01-14T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"Man goes to doctor for toothache, leaves with a shocking prostate cancer diagnosis","desc":"<p>A 78-year-old man was in for a shock when he went to his dentist with a tooth hoping for a quick way to get some pain relief but received news of something much worse.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the dentist decided to remove the tooth, the man was sent home but his jaw began to swell.

The court seized the opportunity to address the systemic neglect of hygiene and sanitation in judicial premises, particularly at the district court level.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Breaking new ground, the bench directed the provision of separate washrooms for transgender persons -- a measure long overdue despite legal recognition of their rights a decade ago. The judgment noted that most high courts lacked dedicated facilities for the transgender community, and their exclusion from basic amenities violated the principles of dignity and equality.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Without such access to the three genders, the states\/UTs can no longer claim to be welfare states,&rdquo; maintained the bench, noting the stark absence of facilities for women, persons with disabilities (PwD) and transgender persons in several court complexes.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The court pointed out the deplorable state of existing facilities, stating that &ldquo;conditions prevailing in many courts are poor, with old toilets in unusable conditions, insufficient water supply, unlocked doors, broken taps, and non-functional fittings hindering proper use.&rdquo; District courts, in particular, were singled out for their &ldquo;most deplorable conditions, failing to meet even basic hygiene standards.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The failure to provide adequate washroom facilities is not just a logistical issue, but it reflects a deeper flaw in the justice system. The sorry state of affairs indicates the harsh reality that the judicial system has not entirely fulfilled its constitutional obligation to provide a safe, dignified, and equal environment for all those seeking justice,&rdquo; it held.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transgender persons, the court noted, are entirely excluded from the planning of toilet facilities in most judicial complexes, despite being recognised as a third gender under the law. &ldquo;The failure to provide adequate facilities for transgender persons reflects a deeper flaw in the justice system,&rdquo; the court stated, adding that such neglect &ldquo;tarnishes the reputation of the judicial system, which should serve as a model of fairness, dignity and justice.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Immediate steps are needed to ensure that all judicial premises, especially those lacking proper facilities, are equipped with accessible washroom facilities for the judges, litigants, advocates, and staff...failing to act promptly would compromise the very purpose and essence of the judiciary&rsquo;s role in our society,&rdquo; underlined the bench.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The court, thus, issued a series of binding directions to rectify these deficiencies. High courts and state governments have been tasked with constructing gender-inclusive washrooms equipped with essential amenities, including sanitary napkin dispensers, tactile pavements for visually impaired individuals, and ramps for wheelchair users. Separate rooms connected to women&rsquo;s washrooms will be built to cater to nursing mothers, with feeding stations and diaper-changing facilities.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>To ensure accountability, the bench directed the formation of committees in every high court, chaired by a judge nominated by the high court chief justice, to oversee the planning and implementation of these facilities. These committees will conduct surveys to assess needs, ensure proper maintenance through professional cleaning agencies, and establish a grievance redressal mechanism for reporting and repairing defective toilets. The court also called for immediate action to address sanitation in family courts, where the absence of child-safe washrooms creates challenges for single-parent litigants.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asserting the urgency of the matter, the bench instructed all high courts and state governments to file compliance reports within four months. The judgment directed that its order be circulated to all high courts and chief secretaries of states and UTs for strict implementation.<\/p>\r\n","img":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/ht-img\/img\/2025\/01\/15\/550x309\/Delivering-the-judgment--a-bench-of-justices-JB-Pa_1736965947799.jpg","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/india-news\/sc-issues-directives-on-separate-toilets-for-trans-persons-in-courts-101736965954554.html","url":"\/sc-issues-directives-on-separate-toilets-for-trans-persons-in-courts.html","category":"India","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2025-01-15T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"Who will present Union Budget 2025?","desc":"<p>The Union Budget 2025, which will be the second full budget of Modi 3.0 is scheduled to be presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, marking her eighth consecutive presentation of a Union Budget.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This also makes her the first Finance Minister to present eight union budgets in a row.

On Saturday, an additional 45.35 lakh gharauni covering more than 29,000 villages were handed out,&rdquo; Adityanath stated.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He distributed property cards to several recipients at his official residence and highlighted the transformative nature of the Svamitva (Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas) Yojana. He emphasized that over 1 crore people in Uttar Pradesh have already received property cards, and the remaining 25,000 beneficiaries will be covered soon.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is the first time since independence that people in rural areas are being granted legal rights to their land,&rdquo; he stated.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He highlighted that the construction of a gram sachivalaya is currently underway in each of the 57,000 gram panchayats in the state, creating significant employment opportunities in every village.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This initiative, aimed at reducing property disputes in villages, ensures legal ownership of homes through technology-driven drone surveys. He said that earlier, powerful individuals would often encroach on the land of weaker villagers. With the introduction of property cards, rightful ownership is now protected, and no one can illegally take possession.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beneficiaries shared how receiving legal documents has made it easier to secure bank loans for businesses and resolve land disputes.<\/p>\r\n","img":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/ht-img\/img\/2025\/01\/18\/550x309\/Chief-minister-Yogi-Adityanath-during-the-distribu_1737227004888.jpg","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/cities\/lucknow-news\/yogi-lauds-svamitva-45l-gharauni-papers-distributed-101737227008330.html","url":"\/yogi-lauds-svamitva-45l-gharauni-papers-distributed.html","category":"Uttar Pradesh","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2025-01-18T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"American podcaster Lex Fridman to host podcast with PM Modi in February","desc":"<h2>Lex Fridman has hosted several prominent figures such as Elon Musk, US President-elect Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among others.<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>American podcaster Lex Fridman announced on Sunday that he will host a podcast with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the end of February.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said that he is excited to visit India for the first time, experience its culture, and meet its people.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I will be doing a podcast with Narendra Modi (@narendramodi), Prime Minister of India, at the end of February.

We will consider this,&rdquo; said the bench, issuing notice to the Union government and seeking a response within three weeks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The top court&rsquo;s observation signals a potential recalibration of the content moderation framework under Indian law, balancing state interests with the fundamental right to free speech.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The petition has demanded procedural safeguards under the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking for Access of Information by Public) Rules, 2009. Filed through advocate Paras Nath Singh, the plea contends that the existing framework does not adhere to principles of natural justice, as content creators are often not notified before their posts are taken down.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Monday, Jaising argued before the court that the existing mechanism fails to comply with the principles of natural justice, as the originator of the information is not intimated. She pointed out that notices are sent only to social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and other intermediaries.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The challenge is not to the power of &lsquo;take down&rsquo; but the fact that no intimation is given to the originator of the impugned information,&rdquo; Jaising submitted. She cited Rule 8 of the 2009 Blocking Rules, which states that information should be given to the &lsquo;person or intermediary.&rsquo; However, she contended that due to the use of the word &lsquo;or,&rsquo; authorities often notify only the platforms, bypassing the original content creator.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bench questioned why an organisation filed the petition rather than an individual directly affected by such takedown actions. &ldquo;Some affected individual or identifiable person could have come before us. If a person is identifiable, notice is to be given to that person. If a person is not identifiable, then the notice is to be given to the intermediary. It can be read in that manner,&rdquo; the court remarked.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Responding, Jaising pointed out that under Rule 16, there is strict confidentiality regarding the information or complaint received, thereby eliminating any scope for judicial review.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The net effect is that no notice is given to me despite a curb on my right to free speech under Article 19(1),&rdquo; she contended. The bench, while acknowledging the concerns, indicated that the rule should be interpreted in a way that ensures notice is given to identifiable individuals before any action is taken against their content.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We will consider this,&rdquo; stated the bench, agreeing to examine the organisation&rsquo;s petition. The court subsequently issued a notice in the matter, directing the respondents to file their replies within three weeks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The petition challenges the constitutional validity of Rules 8, 9, and 16 of the 2009 Blocking Rules and seeks their quashing or modification to ensure better transparency and procedural safeguards. Specifically, it urges the court to declare Rule 8 null and void or, alternatively, to reinterpret the term &lsquo;or&rsquo; as &lsquo;and&rsquo; to mandate notice issuance to both intermediaries and originators. It also calls for striking down or reading down Rule 9 to provide a notice, an opportunity for a hearing, and a copy of the interim order to content creators before a final blocking order is passed.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, the plea seeks the prescription of a standardised notice format that would disclose relevant details to enable affected persons to respond effectively. It also demands disclosure of instances where blocking powers under Rules 8 and 9 were exercised without prior notice to content creators or intermediaries. Additionally, the petition calls for greater transparency in the Review Committee&rsquo;s findings under Rule 14 and records related to proceedings under Section 15 of the IT Blocking Rules.<\/p>\r\n","img":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/ht-img\/img\/2025\/03\/03\/550x309\/The-observation-provides-some-hope-to-individuals-_1741027082341.jpg","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/india-news\/no-takedowns-of-social-media-posts-without-creator-s-response-sc-101741027089572.html","url":"\/no-takedowns-of-social-media-posts-without-creator-s-response-sc.html","category":"India","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2025-03-03T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"\u2018Lakhs of Akash Anands...\u2019: Mayawati's nephew reacts; BJP MP mocks BSP supremo","desc":"<p>Akash Anand on Monday reacted to Mayawati&#39;s decision to remove him from all BSP posts with defiance, saying he is fighting for the self-respect of crores of Dalits, not for his career.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Some people from the opposition party are thinking that my political career is over because of this decision of the party.

The 35-year-old, however, will continue playing Tests and T20Is for his country.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It has been a great ride and I have loved every minute of it. There have been so many amazing times and wonderful memories.

I feel I still have a lot to contribute on that stage.&quot;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Steve Smith&#39;s ODI legacy<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith retires having scored 5800 runs from 170 ODIs for Australia, including 12 centuries, but more importantly as a two-time World Champions. He was part of Australia&#39;s World Cup-winning squads in 2015 under Michael Clarke and in 2023 under Pat Cummins. During his time with the Australian team, Smith succeeded Clarke as captain in 2015, and even though he had to give it up following the infamous ball-tampering scandal in 2018, he returned to the helm and held fort till the end with Cummins injured.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith led Australia in 64 ODIs, achieving 32 suffering 28 defeats. His tenure as captain boasted several standout moments, particularly in his debut year as full-time skipper, when he guided the team to series triumphs over England and India. He also secured the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy and clinched a tri-series title against South Africa and the West Indies in the Caribbean in 2016. More recently, during the 2023-24 home summer, Smith steered Australia to an impressive 3-0 clean sweep against the West Indies.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We fully understand and support Steve&#39;s decision to retire from One Day International cricket. Steve has said on many occasions he is approaching the remainder of his playing career on a series-by-series basis, a position which hasn&#39;t changed and one Cricket Australia supports,&quot; Cricket Australia&#39;s Chairman of Selectors George Bailey said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;His record as a batter across 167 games is exemplary and to leave the format as a two-time World Cup winner cements his legacy as one of the great Australian ODI players. From an NSP standpoint, Steve remains fully committed to Test cricket and is an integral member of and leader within that team.&quot;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith burst onto the international cricket scene in 2010, debuting as a leg-spinning all-rounder against the West Indies. Complementing his run-scoring feats, Smith has also chipped in with the ball, taking 28 wickets at an average of 34.67. His excellence in the 50-over format has not gone unnoticed, earning him the Australian Men&#39;s ODI Player of the Year title in both 2015 and 2021, alongside a well-deserved spot in the ICC Men&#39;s ODI Team of the Year in 2015.<\/p>\r\n","img":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/ht-img\/img\/2025\/03\/05\/550x309\/CRICKET-SRI-AUS-ODI-78_1740202297775_1741155320263.jpg","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/cricket\/steve-smith-announces-shock-retirement-from-odi-cricket-after-australias-champions-trophy-exit-101741155229571.html","url":"\/steve-smith-announces-shock-retirement-from-odi-cricket-after-australias-champions-trophy-exit.html","category":"Sports","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2025-03-04T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"Bengaluru family mysteriously disappears from resort near Bandipur, police launch search: Report","desc":"<p>A Bengaluru-based family has vanished without a trace after staying at a resort near Bandipur in Karnataka&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/cities\/bengaluru-news\/karnataka-govt-declares-holiday-in-chamarajanagar-mysore-districts-on-tuesday-after-srinivas-prasads-demise-101714451761499.html\" target=\"_blank\">Chamarajanagar<\/a>&nbsp;district, prompting a large-scale search operation by police forces from Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/indianexpress.com\/article\/cities\/bangalore\/karnataka-family-missing-from-resort-near-bandipur-abduction-suspected-9868686\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">report&nbsp;<\/a>by Indian Express, the missing individuals have been identified as 40-year-old J Nishanth, his wife Chandana, and their 10-year-old son.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The family checked into the Country Club resort on March 2 but mysteriously left the premises the following day, abandoning their belongings, the report added.

To enhance facilities at the Tirupati temple, the board has implemented special conditions for room allocation based on recommendation letters, increasing the number of rooms available to general devotees.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously, celebrities and individuals in constitutional positions could secure rooms without darshan tickets through recommendation letters. This system has been discontinued. Under the new policy, only devotees with darshan tickets are eligible for room allotment.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The TTD allocates 7,500 rooms daily &mdash; 3,500 for general devotees through the Central Reservation Office (CRO); 1,580 for online bookings; and 400 for donors to various trusts. The remaining rooms are allocated to VIP and VVIP arrivals.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>For room allotment through recommendation letters, devotees must present their Aadhaar card and darshan ticket at the Sri Padmavati Enquiry Office or other designated counters.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This change addresses the issue of brokers who previously hoarded rooms by using recommendation letters and then rented them out at exorbitant prices, leading to complaints of cheating. By linking room allocation to darshan tickets, TTD aims to eliminate this problem and ensure equitable room distribution for all devotees.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Enhanced Safety Measures For Tirumala Devotees<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Tirumala, the revered abode of Sri Venkateswara, attracts millions of devotees daily, many of whom choose the Alipiri and Srivari Mettu walking paths for their pilgrimage. To safeguard these devotees, the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) has been implementing various safety protocols.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, a significant concern has arisen with the increased presence of leopards along these paths. Recently, a tragic incident occurred on the Alipiri footpath, where a leopard attack resulted in the unfortunate demise of a child,. This incident follows a similar one just two months prior, involving a four-year-old boy. These incidents mark the first-ever fatal animal attacks in Tirumala&rsquo;s history.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The leopard population has seen a marked increase following the Covid-19 lockdown, with these animals now more frequently traversing the Seshachalam forest areas, raising concerns among devotees.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>To address this issue, TTD has formulated a comprehensive strategy to mitigate the risk of wild animal encounters for pilgrims. They propose implementing a radio collar system to track the movements of leopards, elephants, bears, and deer around Tirumala. This system will facilitate the creation of a real-time alert network, warning devotees and TTD staff of approaching wild animals.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This alert system, successfully deployed in other locations, has garnered praise from wildlife officials for its potential effectiveness in Tirumala. Once TTD receives the necessary approvals, the process will involve the safe capture and containment of the animals. A radio collar, equipped with a SIM card, will be fitted to each animal to monitor their movements.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A dedicated department in Tirumala will then track these animals via satellite signals, with GPS data triggering alerts whenever animals enter areas frequented by devotees.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This proactive measure aims to prevent future animal-related incidents, ensuring a safer and more tranquil experience for all pilgrims visiting Tirumala.<\/p>\r\n","img":"https:\/\/images.news18.com\/ibnlive\/uploads\/2025\/03\/1600900-10-2025-03-39e8ce91baa94dbd9a057ef6f596574b.png?impolicy=website&width=0&height=0","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.news18.com\/india\/tirupati-temple-news-ttd-makes-big-policy-change-only-these-devotees-will-get-room-allotments-ws-ab-9250160.html","url":"\/tirupati-temple-news-ttd-makes-big-policy-change-only-these-devotees-will-get-room-allotments.html","category":"Andhra Pradesh","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2025-03-05T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"We Are The Only Opposition: Jagan Reddy After Andhra Assembly Setback","desc":"<p>A massive political row has erupted in Andhra Pradesh after Speaker Ayyanna Patrudu rejected YSR Congress Party chief YS Jagan Mohan Reddy&#39;s request for the Leader of the Opposition tag. Terming it an &quot;unreasonable desire&quot;, the Speaker said a party must have a minimum of 18 members to qualify for the Leader of the Opposition post, but YSR Congress has 11.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Reddy, who lost the Chief Minister post after his party was routed in the Assembly polls held alongside the Lok Sabha election last year, has trashed the Speaker&#39;s rationale behind denying him the post and questioned how people&#39;s voices would be raised in the House if the only party in the Opposition is not given sufficient time. He also cited a Delhi example and said the AAP had given the BJP Opposition party status when the latter had just 3 members in the Assembly.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his ruling on Mr Reddy&#39;s request, the Speaker said, &quot;The eligibility for the position of Leader of Opposition is determined solely in accordance with constitutional provisions, legal mandates, and established precedents.&quot; Citing various rules to bolster his ruling, he said, &quot;Accordingly, in the 175-member Legislative Assembly of Andhra Pradesh, unless the largest party in opposition attains a minimum strength of 18 Members, it would be improper to consider the leader of such a party for recognition as the Leader of the Opposition purely on discretion.&quot;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Speaker noted that Mr Reddy had approached the High Court, seeking a direction to the Speaker to designate him as the &#39;Leader of the Opposition&#39;. &quot;The fact is that his writ petition, as of today, is not even admitted by Hon&#39;ble High Court. I am not surprised by the repeated malicious and vitriolic campaign being carried out by Sri Jagan Mohan Reddy,&quot; he said, criticising the YSR Congress chief.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Speaker said Mr Reddy&#39;s allegations attributing motives to the Chair amount to breach of privilege and contempt of the House. &quot;I have decided to treat his diatribe with the contempt it deserves. I am not sure if the House would tolerate any further, recurrence of such deplorable conduct.&quot;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hitting back at the Speaker&#39;s decision, Mr Reddy said YSR Congress is the only party that sits in the Opposition in Andhra Assembly. &quot;BJP, Jana Sena and TDP are together and they are ruling parties. And be it any number, the fact remains that we are 40 per cent vote share. We are the only party in the Opposition, if we are not given the recognition, then who is going to be the Opposition party?

Police used tear gas and live rounds to disperse the protestors, who threw stones and fired at security forces. Two police vehicles were also set ablaze during the unrest.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manipur has been in turmoil since May 2023, with clashes between the dominant Meitei community and the Kuki tribes claiming nearly 250 lives and displacing thousands.

The charge is justified on the grounds that BSWML provides waste collection and disposal services, although concerns remain over the effectiveness of its waste management practices.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This additional charge, linked to property tax, is expected to spark opposition from citizens already grappling with rising expenses. The decision follows a recent fare hike of 45-50 per cent by Namma Metro.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Fee details<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The fee structure is based on the built-up area of a property and is divided into six slabs. Owners of buildings up to 600 sq ft will have to pay&nbsp;\u20b910 per month (&nbsp;\u20b9120 annually), while those with properties larger than 4,000 sq ft will be charged&nbsp;\u20b9400 per month (&nbsp;\u20b94,800 per year). This additional fee is likely to increase the overall property tax burden, the report further added.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>BSWML estimates that the user fee could generate around&nbsp;\u20b9600 crore annually, with the actual revenue potentially exceeding this figure. Additionally, the government has permitted BSWML to charge bulk waste generators&mdash;such as apartment complexes and large commercial establishments&mdash;&nbsp;\u20b912 per kg if they lack an empaneled waste processing agency or an in-situ waste management system.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the publication, despite the introduction of the new user fee, the existing Solid Waste Management (SWM) Cess will remain unchanged. This cess, collected as part of property tax, is allocated for maintaining public spaces, including street sweeping and cleanliness efforts.<\/p>\r\n","img":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/ht-img\/img\/2025\/03\/13\/550x309\/real-estate-Hyderabad_1736344799451_1741834556742.jpg","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/cities\/bengaluru-news\/bengaluru-property-taxes-set-to-rise-as-karnataka-government-approves-waste-collection-fee-report-101741834492965.html","url":"\/bengaluru-property-taxes-set-to-rise-as-karnataka-government-approves-waste-collection-fee-report.html","category":"Karnataka","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2025-03-12T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"Nagpur: Curfew imposed in several areas after violence amid book burning 'rumours'","desc":"<h2>According to Nagpur police commissioner Dr Ravinder Kumar Singal, the curfew will remain in force until further orders.<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>After violence erupted in Maharashtra&#39;s Nagpur on Monday amid rumours of burning of a holy book, authorities have reportedly issued curfew orders for several areas as the city police commissioner assured the residents that the situation was under control.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The violence started in the Mahal area of Nagpur after rumours of the burning of a holy book by a right-wing outfit.(ANI)<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the news agency ANI, a curfew has been imposed in the limits of several police stations in Nagpur city.

The Madras high court says no.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Underscoring a woman&rsquo;s sexual autonomy and that the fundamental right to privacy includes spousal privacy, the Madras high court on Wednesday rejected a man&rsquo;s petition seeking divorce from his wife on the ground that she watched pornography and often masturbated.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Justices GR Swaminathan and R Poornima of the Madurai bench held that if a spouse did not breach any statutory laws in watching pornography and if such habit did not have an adverse impact on the discharge of one&rsquo;s conjugal obligations, such acts cannot be amount to cruelty and therefore, cannot be a ground for divorce.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It further said that watching pornography in a private setting was not an offence.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the husband&rsquo;s argument that the woman &ldquo;often indulged in masturbation,&rdquo; the court said that even calling upon a woman to respond to this averment would amount to a &ldquo;gross infringement of her sexual autonomy.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>When masturbation among men was acknowledged to be universal, masturbation by women cannot be stigmatised, the court said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;If after contracting marriage, a woman has sexual relationship outside marriage, it would furnish ground for divorce. However, indulging in self-pleasure cannot be a cause for dissolution of marriage. By no stretch of imagination, can it be said to inflict cruelty on the husband,&rdquo; the high court said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The court was hearing a petition filed by a resident of Karur district in Tamil Nadu, who had challenged an order of the family court that had refused to grant him divorce from his estranged wife.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The petitioner told the high court that the family court had erred in dismissing his allegations of cruelty, a valid ground for divorce under Section 13(1)(i-a) of the Hindu Marriage Act.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wife, he alleged, was a spendthrift, was &ldquo;addicted to watching porn, refused to do household chores, and often indulged in masturbation. &ldquo;The petitioner also alleged that the wife suffered from a venereal disease.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The high court, however, noted that the man had failed to submit any documents to establish that the woman suffered from any venereal disease, much less that such disease was communicable.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>As per the petition, the couple got married in July 2018. However, they started staying separately in December 2020. While the wife subsequently sought restitution of conjugal rights, the husband filed for divorce on the ground of cruelty, making allegations that the wife was meting out cruelty against him by watching pornography and masturbating.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The high court however, cited a previous judgment passed by justice Swaminathan in October 2024 where the judge who was presiding over a single bench at the time, had held that one&rsquo;s right to privacy included spousal privacy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its present order, the bench said, &ldquo;When privacy is a fundamental right, it includes within its scope and reach spousal privacy too. The contours of spousal privacy would include various aspects of a woman&rsquo;s sexual autonomy. So long as something does not fall foul of law, the right to express oneself cannot be denied.

Farmers are an important voting bloc and resolving their demand for assured MSP is one of the biggest challenges for Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s government.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Thursday, the police cleared both the protest camps at Shambhu and Khanauri, opening the highways blockaded by farm unions for over a year. The farmers had been camping at these sites since February 2024.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chahal said the farm unions were &ldquo;surprised and shocked&rdquo; by the sudden police action. He said several police vehicles followed Dallewal and other farm leaders when they were returning from their meeting with the Union ministers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Police teams waylaid our leaders and detained them using force a few kilometers ahead of Shambhu border. The Punjab government has stabbed us in the back,&rdquo; Chahal added.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The farm leader said Dallewal&rsquo;s health was deteriorating because he of his fast until death and following his detention at a police facility, he had stopped taken water.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another farm leader, Sukhwinder Singh Sabhra, who took part in Wednesday&rsquo;s meeting with the three central ministers, alleged that the AAP-led Punjab government was using the pretext of disruption of trade activities to evict the farmers. &ldquo;Farmers haven&rsquo;t hampered trade.

On Saturday morning, justice Upadhyaya had met with officials from the Delhi Police, Delhi Fire Services (DFS), and the Supreme Court&rsquo;s vigilance department before submitting an additional report to the CJI. This report led to the formation of the inquiry panel.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The controversy stems from a reported fire at Justice Varma&rsquo;s official residence on Tughlak Road on March 14 at around 11:35 pm. While DFS officials extinguished the fire within minutes, first responders&mdash;including DFS personnel and possibly the police&mdash;allegedly discovered stacks of cash in a storeroom, some of which were reportedly charred. Justice Varma and his wife were in Bhopal at the time.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>On March 20, the Supreme Court collegium unanimously recommended transferring justice Varma to the Allahabad high court&mdash;his parent high court. However, during deliberations, at least two members argued that a mere transfer was insufficient and pushed for an immediate in-house inquiry. One judge insisted that justice Varma be stripped of judicial work immediately, while another pressed for a formal investigation to ensure institutional accountability.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The matter has also sparked reactions from the judiciary and legal fraternity. The Allahabad high court Bar Association (HCBA) strongly opposed justice Varma&rsquo;s transfer, questioning whether the Allahabad high court was being treated as a &ldquo;dumping ground.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The controversy has also resonated in Parliament. In the Rajya Sabha on March 21, chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar responded to Congress MP Jairam Ramesh&rsquo;s call for greater judicial accountability by stating that he would explore mechanisms for structured discussions on the issue. Dhankhar appeared to hint at reviving the debate over the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC), which was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2015.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Justice Yashwant Varma has strongly denied any connection to the cash allegedly found at his residence, claiming that he is being framed as part of a conspiracy to malign him. In his response to the CJI&rsquo;s queries &ndash; which was made public a day ago, justice Varma wrote: &ldquo;I unequivocally state that neither I nor any of my family members had stored or kept any cash or currency in that storeroom at any point of time. The very idea or suggestion that this cash was kept or stored by us is totally preposterous.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Justice Varma further argued that the video purportedly showing burnt cash was not an accurate representation of what he had witnessed. &ldquo;I was totally shocked to see the contents of the video since that depicted something which was not found on site as I had seen it. It was this which prompted me to observe that this clearly appeared to be a conspiracy to frame and malign me,&rdquo; he wrote. He also questioned the timing and authenticity of the allegations, linking them to previous unsubstantiated accusations against him on social media in December 2024.<\/p>\r\n","img":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/ht-img\/img\/2025\/03\/23\/550x309\/On-Saturday--CJI-Khanna-constituted-a-three-member_1742756492965.jpg","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/india-news\/justice-varma-probe-disclosure-triggers-internal-judicial-debate-101742756500537.html","url":"\/justice-varma-probe-disclosure-triggers-internal-judicial-debate.html","category":"Delhi","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2025-03-23T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"RSS leader weighs in on Aurangzeb row: 'Why Dara Shikoh not considered a hero'","desc":"<h2>Dara Shikoh was the eldest son of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan and is said to be a pioneer of interfaith understanding in India.<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale on Sunday slammed the &ldquo;advocates for the Ganga-Jamuni culture&quot;, which promotes harmony between cultures.

However, alongside this much-needed respite, an unusual phenomenon puzzled citizens&mdash;white foam mysteriously covered some city roads.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Viral video sparks curiosity<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A video capturing this bizarre sight has now gone viral on Instagram.

These engines are meant for the 83 Mk-1As ordered by the IAF for&nbsp;\u20b948,000 crore in February 2021.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The engine was delivered to an HAL team at Lynn in Massachusetts and will reach India in a few days, marking what will be a two-year delay.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;On Tuesday, we were excited to deliver the first of 99 F404-IN20 engines to our valued customer HAL... It is an important milestone in our 40-year relationship with HAL and in our efforts to ensure a strong future for India&rsquo;s military by developing next-generation fighters while enhancing the country&rsquo;s defense manufacturing capabilities,&rdquo; said Shawn Warren, general manager, combat and trainer engines, GE Aerospace.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The IAF has been concerned about the pace of the Mk-1A programme because of the possible risks a delay in the induction of new fighters could pose to its combat effectiveness. The first Mk-1A jets were slated to be delivered in March, 2024.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Air Force plans to order 97 more Mk-1As at a cost of around&nbsp;\u20b967,000 crore.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>GE Aerospace is expected to deliver 12 engines this year.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The F404-IN20 engine represents a tailored design for the Mk-1A single-engine fighter with the highest thrust within the F404 family, which powers thousands of combat aircraft worldwide, he said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;GE Aerospace looks forward to continuing the collaboration with HAL to ensure a strong future for India&rsquo;s military, working together to provide aircraft and marine engines, avionics, and maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) services,&rdquo; Warren said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The delay in Mk-1a deliveries is down to a combination of factors. Apart from the engine delays, some key certifications were held up.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2004, the F404-IN20 engine was selected for the older LCA Mk-1, which has been inducted by the IAF. By 2016, GE Aerospace delivered 65 F404-IN20 engines for the Mk-1 aircraft.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>With no additional engine orders, the production line for F404-IN20 in the US was shut down. &ldquo;However, when HAL ordered an additional 99 engines in 2021 for the LCA Mk-1A, our team began the complex task of restarting the production line, which had been dormant for five years, and re-engaging the engine&rsquo;s global supply chain,&rdquo; Warren said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a statement, he explained the challenges in restarting a jet engine production line.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Restarting the F404-IN20 engine line during the Covid pandemic was even more challenging. With a high focus on safety and quality, and a remarkable commitment from our supply chain teams and our suppliers and partners, we have managed to restart the line. Our operating model helped us alleviate bottlenecks and identify solutions to improve manufacturing processes and turnaround time. Today, we are working closely with our suppliers to ramp up production on parts and materials for the F404-IN20,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>HAL has set up a new production line in Nashik for Mk-1As to meet the IAF&rsquo;s growing needs. The firm says it can build 16 Mk-1As every year in Bengaluru, and the Nashik line will help it ramp up production to 24 jets annually.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We will continue to work together with our suppliers to keep the production line efficient, maintain the highest standards of safety and quality, and deliver to our customer. This week&rsquo;s first engine delivery is a testament to what we have accomplished with HAL over the past 40 years, and a symbol of our combined potential to ensure a strong future for India&rsquo;s military.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In February, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal AP Singh, questioned the ability of HAL to meet the air force&rsquo;s critical requirements in the backdrop of the lingering delay in supply of the LCA-Mk-1A, saying he had &ldquo;no confidence&rdquo; in the plane maker. The remarks, made during an interaction with HAL officials, were recorded by someone.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>HAL chief DK Sunil responded by saying that the plane maker&rsquo;s focus was on delivering the new aircraft at the earliest rather than spending time on countering criticism of the indigenous programme.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>HAL hopes to execute the contract for the 83 Mk-1As over the next three-and-a-half years. The upcoming follow-on contract for 97 more fighters is likely to be signed soon, and HAL plans to execute it by 2031-32.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Mk-1A is an advanced variant of the Mk-1.

He urged the Reserve Bank of India to regulate these charges and ensure faster complaint resolution for customers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chadha said credit card debt is pushing the middle class into financial distress and that excessive loan recovery pressure is affecting bank employees.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He urged the government to promote financial literacy, regulate loan recovery practices and provide better working conditions for banking staff.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without major reforms, Chadha said, public confidence in India&#39;s banking system would continue to decline, impacting millions of citizens who rely on banks for savings and financial security.<\/p>\r\n","img":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/ht-img\/img\/2024\/12\/18\/550x309\/India_3_1734523619133_1734523643821.jpg","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/india-news\/aaps-raghav-chadha-claims-public-trust-in-banks-declining-slams-banking-laws-amendment-bill-101743015849269.html","url":"\/aaps-raghav-chadha-claims-public-trust-in-banks-declining-slams-banking-laws-amendment-bill.html","category":"Delhi, Politics","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2025-03-26T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"Supreme Court stays Allahabad high court's 'grabbing breasts not rape' ruling: 'Insensitivity'","desc":"<h2>The Supreme Court stayed the controversial order of the Allahabad high court and said the judgment showed a &ldquo;lack of sensitivity&quot;.<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Supreme Court on Wednesday stayed the controversial order of Allahabad high court, which observed that acts like grabbing breasts or breaking the string of pyjamas do not constitute an attempt to rape, and the prosecution must go beyond this &ldquo;stage of preparation&rdquo; to prove its charges against a rape accused.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Supreme Court took suo motu cognizance of the case after an organisation &lsquo;We the Women of India&rsquo; approached the apex court against the March 17 order of the Allahabad high court.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bench of Justices BR Gavai and Augustine George Masih said the judgment showed a &ldquo;lack of sensitivity&rdquo; on the part of the high court judge.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We are pains to state that it shows a total lack of sensitivity on the part of the author of the judgment.

Incidentally, the visit by both Modi and Vajpayee, who visited RSS headquarters in 2000, came during their third term as the PM. Modi&rsquo;s last visit to Sangh&rsquo;s administrative headquarters came in 2013, when he was the chief minister of Gujarat.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>During his trip, PM Modi visited the Dr Hedgewar Smruti Mandir at RSS headquarters and paid homage to the founding fathers of the Sangh. He also laid the foundation stone of Madhav Netralaya Premium Centre, a new extension building of Madhav Netralaya Eye Institute &amp; Research Centre, named after late RSS chief Madhavrao Golwalkar.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The RSS is the modern Akshay Vat (banyan tree) of the immortal culture of India and is continuously energising Indian culture and the consciousness of our nation,&rdquo; Modi said, while speaking at the Madhav Netralaya event.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Modi &mdash; who was accompanied by RSS sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat, Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Union minister Nitin Gadkari during his visit &mdash; said the volunteers of Sangh are working selflessly in various spheres and parts of the country.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of RSS volunteers, the PM lauded their &ldquo;exemplary work&rdquo; during the recently concluded Maha Kumbh fair in Prayagraj, where they assisted millions through the Netra Kumbh initiative, saying that wherever there is a need for service, the volunteers are present.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Decades of effort and dedication by the RSS are bearing fruit, writing a new chapter in India&rsquo;s development, Modi said. Pointing out that the period from 1925 to 1947 was of crisis as the country was fighting for independence, he said that 100 years later, the RSS is now stepping into another milestone.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This period is important because big goals are ahead of us. We have to lay the foundation stone of the next 1,000 years of a strong and developed India,&rdquo; he said, noting that the country is celebrating 75 years of the Constitution this year and the RSS is completing 100 years (of its formation).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Modi&rsquo;s visit to the RSS headquarters also dispels speculations of a growing rift between the Sangh and the BJP, rumours that have been doing rounds since the Lok Sabha elections last summer.

To address the frequent civic and infrastructure challenges in the area, the state has allocated&nbsp;\u20b9400 crore to upgrade the 22.7-kilometre stretch. Dr. Harish Kumar K, Special Commissioner (Finance) said that the project aims to bring ORR up to world-class standards through collaboration with the Government of Karnataka and the Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Ltd.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a report in&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.deccanherald.com\/india\/karnataka\/bengaluru\/rs-400-cr-allocated-to-make-orr-world-class-3469244\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Deccan Herald<\/a>, the initiative is part of a broader set of development projects announced in the budget. Prioritizing pedestrian safety, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has committed to constructing 1,000 kilometres of footpaths. These will be integrated into ongoing arterial and sub-arterial road projects and incorporated into all future road developments.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, the budget reaffirmed support for two major ongoing infrastructure efforts. The first is the white-topping of 157 kilometres of roads, with an estimated budget of&nbsp;\u20b91,700 crore. The second involves asphalting 118 roads at a cost of&nbsp;\u20b9694 crore. To further bolster civic infrastructure, BBMP has earmarked&nbsp;\u20b92.5 crore per ward for capital works and&nbsp;\u20b950 lakh per ward for maintenance, adding up to a total allocation of&nbsp;\u20b9675 crore across 225 wards.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The civic body has also announced new railway infrastructure projects, including a railway over-bridge at 1st Main Road in Kengeri and an under-bridge near Ramohalli Gate, with&nbsp;\u20b920 crore set aside for these developments. Despite over two dozen manned railway crossings in the city, little effort has been made to systematically eliminate them by constructing railway overpasses.

One of the key drivers of rising electricity demand is climate change-induced heat stress.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The forecast follows an unusually warm March, raising concerns about potential damage to wheat crops currently being harvested. A drop in production could push the government to reduce or remove the 40% import duty on wheat, according to a Bloomberg report. India had already restricted exports since 2022 after the hottest March in over a century impacted output, leading to measures to control food prices.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Higher temperatures will also increase coal consumption in power plants to prevent blackouts in the world&#39;s most populous country. Ensuring an uninterrupted power supply is critical to providing relief from the heat and supporting hospitals in managing heat-related illnesses.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a record peak electricity demand anticipated this summer, policymakers have instructed power plant operators to avoid maintenance shutdowns during this period.

The JD(U) has also issued a whip to its members to remain present in the House and has clarified that it supports the bill, which seeks to bring sweeping changes to how waqf properties are regulated.

Of the 542 MPs, 240 are BJP lawmakers,12 are from the JD(U), 16 from the TDP, five from the LJP (RV), two from the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and seven from the Shiv Sena.

The Republican leader on Monday said India will be among the countries that drop tariffs in response to his move.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indian officials say they have mapped out four possible scenarios and their potential implications for Indian trade. In a product-specific scenario, Chinese, Mexican, Canadian and EU exports would likely be most affected, potentially making Indian exports more competitive. Sector-specific measures would impact all global players including India by increasing costs and reducing margins. And both country-specific and secondary tariff scenarios would adversely affect India&rsquo;s economy, according to two people close to the development.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;In this atmosphere of uncertainty, where even Americans are guessing, we will wait for the announcements and evaluate their net impact on our trade and economy,&rdquo; said a person close to the developments, who asked not to be named.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This stance stems from India&rsquo;s focus on evaluating trade deals based on complementarity rather than just tariff levels. &ldquo;In any bilateral trade deal, the net impact is evaluated on the basis of complementarity and not just on the basis of quantum of tariffs,&rdquo; a second person said, citing India&rsquo;s free trade agreement with the United Arab Emirates.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under that FTA, India reduced import tariff for liquefied natural gas imports from UAE to zero because it (India) is energy deficient, &ldquo; hence no domestic competition on the product,&rdquo; the second person added.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most significant factor influencing India&rsquo;s calm approach is the progress already made in bilateral negotiations. &ldquo;So far, nothing adverse has happened. In fact, four-day negotiations for a proposed BTA (bilateral trade agreement) in New Delhi went well,&rdquo; the second person noted.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We are currently engaged as per the joint statement agreed by leaders of the two countries. When two partners are in talks nothing unexpected is expected.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Washington, where the administration released an encyclopaedic report on the tariffs and non-tariff barriers on Monday, covering most countries the US trades with, including India, US President Trump said India will be &ldquo;dropping its tariffs very substantially&rdquo;.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think a lot of (countries) will drop their tariffs because they&rsquo;ve been unfairly tariffing the United States for years. If you look at the European Union on cars, the European Union already dropped their tariff to 2.5 per cent. It was announced a couple of days ago. A very small tariff. The United States charged very little,&rdquo; Trump said while responding to questions in the Oval Office on Monday.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think I heard that India, just a little while ago, is going to be dropping its tariffs very substantially. I said, why didn&rsquo;t somebody do this a long time ago. A lot of countries are going to be dropping their tariffs,&rdquo; he added.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reports, meanwhile, indicated White House aides have drafted plans for tariffs of about 20% on most of the $3 trillion of goods imported annually to the US. The Washington Post, which reported the number, quoted White House advisers as saying that no final decision has been made and that several options are on the table.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s administration is also weighing using the trillions of dollars it expects in new import revenue for a tax dividend or refund, the report said, citing three unnamed people familiar with the matter.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Sunday. Trump said the reciprocal tariffs will target all nations, and the White House on Monday said any country that had treated Americans unfairly should expect to receive a tariff.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Representatives for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reported proposal.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>On February 13, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump resolved to deepen US-India trade relations, aiming to boost total bilateral trade from about $200 billion to $500 billion by 2030&mdash;an ambitious initiative dubbed &ldquo;Mission 500.&rdquo; Unlike some other countries that have seen Trump abandon previous trade discussions, these negotiations appear to be proceeding constructively.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Minister of state for commerce Jitin Prasada confirmed in Parliament on Tuesday that &ldquo;as on date, reciprocal tariffs have not been applied by US on India.&rdquo; He added that both countries remain committed to negotiating a &ldquo;mutually beneficial, multi-sector Bilateral Trade Agreement&rdquo; focused on increasing market access, reducing barriers, enhancing supply chain integration and resolving bilateral trade issues.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal provided context for India&rsquo;s broader trade philosophy in a statement tabled in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday: &ldquo;India&rsquo;s tariff policy aims to regulate trade, protect domestic industries, and generate revenue through taxes on imported and exported goods.&rdquo; He noted that India is moving toward preferential and free trade agreements wherein tariffs and non-tariff barriers are reduced or eliminated on substantial trade between partner countries.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>India&rsquo;s approach stands in marked contrast to the European Union&rsquo;s preparations for strong retaliatory measures. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen declared on Tuesday that the EU has &ldquo;a strong plan to retaliate and will use it&rdquo; if necessary, with countermeasures on up to &euro;26 billion of US goods reportedly being readied.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, while the UK scrambles to secure a last-minute economic arrangement with the US &mdash;with Prime Minister Keir Starmer acknowledging tariffs are likely despite &ldquo;rapid progress&rdquo; in negotiations&mdash;India appears content to let its existing dialogue with the US continue on the path set by the Modi-Trump joint statement in February.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>India is also watching with interest the regional cooperation developing among Asian powers. China, Japan and South Korea held their first economic dialogue in five years on Sunday, reportedly discussing ways to strengthen supply chain cooperation.<\/p>\r\n","img":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/ht-img\/img\/2025\/04\/01\/550x309\/TRUMP-EXECUTIVE-ORDER-9_1743488305313_1743546801326.jpg","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/india-news\/india-weighs-options-ahead-of-trump-s-tariff-action-today-101743532850456.html","url":"\/india-weighs-options-ahead-of-trump-s-tariff-action-today.html","category":"India, United States","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2025-04-01T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"German woman alleges \u2018rape\u2019 by car driver in Hyderabad; one arrested","desc":"<h2>Hyderabad: A senior official said that police filed a case and detained the accused after the German woman alleged he raped her in the car.<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A 22-year-old German woman has alleged that she was sexually assaulted by a car driver in Telangana&#39;s Hyderabad after he offered her and her friend a ride to explore the city, news agency PTI reported on Tuesday.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In her complaint, she claimed that the driver&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/cities\/gurugram-news\/man-who-raped-6-year-old-girl-at-age-of-17-sentenced-to-life-imprisonment-in-gurugram-101743444975542.html\" target=\"_blank\">raped<\/a>&nbsp;her in the rear seat of the car on Monday late evening.

The Lok Sabha has already approved the Bill.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Waqf (Amendment) Bill 2025 aims to streamline the management of Waqf properties, with provisions to safeguard heritage sites and promote social welfare. The legislation also aims to improve governance by enhancing transparency in property management, streamlining coordination between Waqf Boards and local authorities and protecting stakeholders&rsquo; rights. The Bill also seeks to improve the economic and social status of Muslim women, particularly widows and divorced women. The Bill is intended to make the Waqf Board more inclusive, having representation from different Muslim sects for better Waqf governance and decision-making. The Waqf (Amendment) establishes a secular, transparent, and accountable system for Waqf administration.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Replying to a debate on the bill, Minority Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju said that crores of poor Muslims will benefit from this legislation and in no way does it harm any single Muslim.

He said the Narendra Modi government works with the vision of Sabka Saath and Sabka Vikas, and it does not discriminate against any community. He said that poor and Pasmanda Muslims came to meet him and urged that the bill should be passed soon. He said that the government wants to bring the Muslims into the mainstream of the country.

He made it clear that there will be 22 members in the Central Waqf Council, including the ex-officio members and in the Council, there will not be more than four non-Muslim members. He also said that out of the eleven members of the Waqf Board, only three will be Non-Muslims.

He urged the opposition parties to support this bill.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>While participating in the discussion, Dr. Syed Naseer Hussain of the Congress said that this bill is misleading and has been brought with the intention of communal polarisation. He alleged that the BJP is trying to divide the communities. He said that during the BJP government, the budget was not allocated for the Waqf Council, and salaries were not paid to the employees of the council. Interrupting Dr. Hussain, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said that the opposition is trying to mislead the people.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participating in the debate, Union Minister and Leader of the House JP Nadda hoped that the House would support UMEED- Unified Waqf Management Empowerment, Efficiency and Development. He added that the basic aim of this Bill is to bring in reforms and proper management of Waqf properties.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tiruchi Siva of the DMK opposed the bill alleging that a certain community is being targeted. He said the bill is anti-secular and unconstitutional. Mohammad Nadimul Haque of the TMC said the bill is against the fundamental rights of the people.&nbsp; Sanjay Singh of the Aam Aadmi Party termed this bill unconstitutional and urged the government to take it back. Professor Manoj Kumar Jha of the RJD questioned the intent and content of the bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Radha Mohan Das of the BJP alleged that no work was done to improve the lives of poor Muslims during the Congress rule. He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi brought this bill for the betterment of poor Muslim communities.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>JD(S) chief HD Devegowda congratulated the Narendra Modi government for bringing the Bill. He said Waqf properties have been misused by people who are rich or strong enough in the community.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanjay Raut of the Shiv Sena (UBT) alleged that this Bill is not in favour of the nation. Samajwadi Party&rsquo;s Dr Ram Gopal Yadav claimed that the country is moving towards a totalitarian state instead of a democratic state.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge opposed the Bill and demanded the government to withdraw it. He said that there are shortcomings in the bill and it is against the Constitutional norms.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr M Thambidurai of AIADMK said that the government has brought the legislation to change the composition of the Waqf Boards and the Waqf Board Council.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sudhanshu Trivedi of the BJP said that the government has brought this bill for the welfare of poor Muslims.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Ramdas Athawale said that the bill is not unconstitutional as it integrates every minority community.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abhishek Manu Singhvi of the Congress, Praful Patel of the NCP, Dr Fauzia Khan of the NCP-SCP, Gulam Ali Nominated, Milind Murli Deora of the Shiv Sena, and Jose K Mani of KC(M) were among those who participated in the debate.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parliament also gave its approval to the Mussalman Wakf (Repeal) Bill, 2025 which repeals the Mussalman Wakf Act 1923, with the Rajya Sabha approving it.

At 2.36 am, after over 12 hours of discussion on The Waqf(Amendment) Bill 2025, Union home minister Amit Shah moved the statutory resolution in the Rajya Sabha. It was approved by the House at 3.58 am after a discussion that saw the participation of 11 speakers, including Shah, who responded to the debate.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The resolution was passed in the Upper House, a day after the Lok Sabha approved it at 2.40 am on Thursday. In the Lok Sabha, Shah had moved the resolution at 2 am.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Thursday evening, amid discussion of the Waqf Amendment bill 2025, the leader of the opposition in the house Mallikarjun Kharge requested the Chair to schedule the Manipur discussion for the following day as the Waqf Bill discussion would continue till late at night leaving little time for Manipur. The request was not heeded. The Chair informed the house that the matter was listed in the agenda for Thursday.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later when other opposition leaders, also made a similar request, Shah responded, &ldquo;Manipur is an important issue. Why don&rsquo;t you work till late night for once tonight?&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kharge, who started the discussion, questioned why Prime Minister Narendra Modi had not visited Manipur in the last two years. The senior Congress leader also asked the government to present a white paper on Manipur stating the facts of the ethnic clashes. &ldquo;I demand an inquiry and a white paper to be presented in the House. Everybody will then know what is happening in the state&hellip;.BJP has no plan in place to restore peace. They have allowed conflict to deepen.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kharge also said that the BJP government does not have a plan to restore peace. He said it seems a new experiment is being tried there every day. Referring to the Centre imposing the President&rsquo;s Rule, he said, &ldquo; The CM should have taken responsibility and resigned. BJP was working to save the CM and not Manipur. The President&rsquo;s Rule has not been imposed to save Manipur but to save the party&rsquo;s prospects there,&rdquo; he said while listing the different incidents reported from Manipur state in the last 2 years.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his reply, Shah said the resolution was moved towards the end of the session because even as the session was on the government had been holding talks separately with both groups. &ldquo;While the house was in session, two talks have already been held. We are confident that a joint meeting with both groups will soon be held in New Delhi,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shah said the President&rsquo;s Rule was not imposed because of the failing law and order, as claimed by the opposition. &ldquo;There was no violence in November, December, and even until now. The CM had resigned which paved the way for President&#39;s Rule. The claims that Congress was set to bring a no-confidence motion is incorrect. They did not have the numbers. The President&rsquo;s Rule was imposed only after the governor consulted all parties and no MLAs came forward to stake claim,&rdquo; he added.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Replying to one MP&rsquo;s question on whether the government had a deadline to restore peace, like the one they have set to end Naxalism, Shah clarified, &ldquo;There is a difference between Naxalism and ethnic violence. Let me clarify what is happening in Manipur . It is not terrorism or communal clashes. Tackling ethnic clashes is different,&rdquo; he said adding how in the past ethnic clashes in Manipur dragged on from seven months to 10 years. Shah also reiterated that in all these ethnic clashes that went on for years, the PMs who were of the INDIA alliance had not visited Manipur.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shah reiterated how the violence was started by a high court order that has been set aside by the Supreme Court. &ldquo;In the seven years before May 2023 there were no strikes, blockades or curfews in Manipur. There was unrest among the tribal population only after the HC order. There was a feeling of insecurity that spread after the HC order. The situation was volatile. The SC has already set aside the order.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trinamool MP Derek O Brien spoke about violence in the state crimes against women and questioned the timing of moving the statutory resolution at 3 in the morning. &ldquo;On the last day of the Parliament, you move the resolution. Why did you not bring it in the morning? What is Manipur&rsquo;s fault? They are Indian citizens Look at the irony. Discussing Manipur in the dead of the night when there are no prime time or TV channels. Look at Manipur during the day. Look at Manipur in the eye and talk to Manipur. &rdquo; Brien said, adding that the PM should visit the state.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shah said that the Trinamool MP should first look at the situation in West Bengal. He said, &ldquo;Yes there were crimes against women. But it was ethnic in Manipur between two groups. What happened in Bengal was not ethnic clashes. What happened in Sandekhali ? For years, women were subjected to harassment there and your government did nothing. Nothing was done in RG Kar. In fact some of your own party members were involved in the crime. In Manipur&rsquo;s case, we do not support one group or the other.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The union home minister said he had checked the records of the past(during the ethnic clashes) and found out that that the BJP had never politicised the issue like some in the opposition are doing for political gain today.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>President&rsquo;s Rule was imposed on February 13 in Manipur after then chief minister N Biren Singh resigned on February 9, following nearly two years of ethnic violence that killed at least 260 people and displaced another 50,000. It was imposed four days after chief minister Biren Singh&rsquo;s resignation. The assembly has not been dissolved and is currently under suspended animation. Suspended Animation means that the assembly is not dissolved, and the legislators of Manipur will continue to be the MLAs. Such a situation allows the party with majority strength in the house to try form a government in the existing assembly at a later stage.<\/p>\r\n","img":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/ht-img\/img\/2025\/04\/04\/550x309\/ANI-20250403311-0_1743731821279_1743731829394.jpg","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/india-news\/rajya-sabha-passes-statutory-resolution-confirming-president-s-rule-in-manipur-101743731338912.html","url":"\/rajya-sabha-passes-statutory-resolution-confirming-president-s-rule-in-manipur.html","category":"Manipur","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2025-04-03T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"Trump tariffs: Gems & jewellery, electronics and garments will be worst-hit, says trade expert","desc":"<h2>10% tariff takes effect on April 5, while 27% applies from April 9, notes Biswajit Dhar, Professor &amp; Head, Centre for WTO Studies, IIFT.<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The 37% reciprocal tariff imposed by US President Donald Trump could be impacting India&#39;s exports, hitting multiple industries, a top Indian trade and tariff expert has said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It will be instructive to remember that 10% of the tariff imposition becomes effective from April 5 while 27% becomes applicable from April 9,&rdquo; Biswajit Dhar, Professor and Head of the Centre for WTO Studies at the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most impacted sectors on account of the US decision would be gems and jewellery, electronics and clothes, he said. &quot;While Indian domestic sectors are protected from first-level effects, Indian textiles, electronics, and gems &amp; jewellery exporters will be immediately impacted, as exporters will bear the brunt of the increased costs,&rdquo; he told this reporter.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Could these impositions act as a catalyst for a manufacturing boom, as some experts seem to predict? According to Dhar, that&#39;s easier said than done. He said that countries like Malaysia and Indonesia are possibly better positioned than India.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We may regain some lost ground in garments now that Bangladesh faces higher tariffs, but the reality is we&#39;ve treated garments as a sunset sector and failed to invest. Without building capacity, how can we truly benefit from these tariff shifts?&quot;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though agriculture will not be seriously impacted because India&rsquo;s agriculture exports to the US are not substantial, the lack of investment even in this sector shows. &quot;In a way, the US President is holding up a mirror to us. We&#39;ve done little to invest in agriculture&#39;s productive capacity. For now, buying time is the best strategy - maybe offering the US cheaper imports of industrial goods as a trade-off.&quot;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Dhar&rsquo;s view, India&#39;s agricultural challenges aren&#39;t just external. Much of the sector&#39;s struggles are &quot;its own doing&quot;. Smallholder farmers, owning over 85% of holdings, lack investment capacity, while the private sector shows little interest. Farming receives less than 6% of India&#39;s total government and private infrastructure investment, leaving irrigation and storage facilities underfunded.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what are India&rsquo;s best choices at the moment? India will have to &quot;play hardball. Basically, tell the US - we&#39;re open to negotiations on other fronts,&rdquo; Dhar points out.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since February this year, India has ramped up efforts to win Trump&#39;s favour - pledging $25bn in US energy imports, courting Washington as a top defence supplier and exploring F-35 fighter deals. To ease trade tensions, New Delhi scrapped the 6% digital ad tax, cut bourbon whiskey tariffs to 100% from 150% and slashed duties on luxury cars and solar cells.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even as Elon Musk&#39;s Starlink nears final approval, the two countries have launched extensive trade talks to narrow the US&#39;s $45bn trade deficit with India.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Trump&rsquo;s announcement during his &lsquo;Liberation Day&rsquo; address revealed, none of it has been able to impress the US, as India braces up to assess its potential damage in the days ahead. What will be keenly watched is how it tackles its trade troubles with a strong political ally.<\/p>\r\n","img":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/ht-img\/img\/2025\/04\/03\/550x309\/Donald_Trump_1743680145944_1743680146293.JPG","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/india-news\/trump-tariffs-india-worst-hit-sector-trade-expert-101743680020468.html","url":"\/trump-tariffs-india-worst-hit-sector-trade-expert.html","category":"World","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2025-04-03T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"Andhra cabinet approves ArcelorMittal steel plant to be set up in Anakapalli","desc":"<h2>State information and public relations minister said that the cabinet also approved the company&rsquo;s request to establish a captive port with a 2.9 km waterfront at DL Puram village in Anakapalli district.<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Andhra Pradesh cabinet chaired by chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Thursday approved ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India Limited&rsquo;s (AMNSL) proposal to establish a steel plant in Anakapalli district with a production capacity of 17.8 million tonnes per annum in two phases, with an investment of around&nbsp;\u20b91.35 lakh crore.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;In the first phase, a steel plant with a production capacity of 7.3 million tonnes per year will be set up with an investment of&nbsp;\u20b955,964 crore, and production is targeted to commence by January 2029.

India, he said, is &ldquo;aware of its special responsibility&rdquo; in the context of Bimstec, having the longest coastline of 6,500 km in the Bay of Bengal and sharing borders with five members of the bloc.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Our northeastern region in particular is emerging as a connectivity hub for the Bimstec, with a myriad network of roads, railways, waterways, grids and pipelines,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Furthermore, the completion of the Trilateral Highway will connect India&rsquo;s northeast all the way to the Pacific Ocean, a veritable game-changer. We are conscious that our cooperation and facilitation are an essential pre-requisite for the smooth flow of goods, services and people in this larger geography.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this geo-strategic factor in mind, India has devoted increased attention to strengthening Bimstec in the last decade. &ldquo;We also believe that cooperation is an integrated outlook, not one subject to cherry-picking,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Trilateral Highway was initially conceived as a link between India, Myanmar and Thailand. India later proposed extending it to Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. However, the fighting in Myanmar has affected work on the project.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>During a recent visit to China, Yunus focused on India&rsquo;s northeast, which shares a nearly 1,600-km border with Bangladesh, while making a pitch for Chinese investments. &ldquo;Seven states of India&hellip; called seven sisters, they are a landlocked region of India. They have no way to reach out to the ocean. We are the only guardian of the ocean for all this region,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This opens up a huge possibility, this could be an extension of the Chinese economy,&rdquo; Yunus said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yunus&rsquo; remarks were denounced by political leaders in the northeast at a time when India-Bangladesh relations are at a fresh low.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jaishankar also said Bimstec should adopt a more ambitious approach at a time of global churn that is creating a new order which is more regional and agenda-specific.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He addressed the meeting, part of preparations for the Bimstec Summit on Friday, hours after US President Donald Trump unveiled his reciprocal tariffs, triggering concerns about spiralling trade wars. Five members of the grouping were hit by Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;discounted reciprocal tariffs&rdquo; &ndash; Sri Lanka and Myanmar (both 44%), Bangladesh (37%), Thailand (36%) and India (26%).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without referring to the US tariffs, Jaishankar said the ministers were meeting in &ldquo;very uncertain and volatile times&rdquo;, when the global order is in churn. &ldquo;This should encourage us to approach Bimstec from a more ambitious perspective. The new order, whose outlines have only now started to become visible, is intrinsically more regional and agenda-specific,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The era when a few powers underwrote the international system is now behind us. What we make of our prospects is very much dependent on ourselves. As developing nations who face a multitude of challenges, that is better done in concert with each other than individually.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jaishankar pointed out that Bimstec members are performing below their potential in terms of trade, investment, connectivity or services between themselves. India not only connects most Bimstec members but also &ldquo;provides much of the interface between the Indian subcontinent and Asean&rdquo;, he said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jaishankar said that for India, Bimstec represents the trifecta of the &ldquo;Act East&rdquo; and &ldquo;Neighbourhood First&rdquo; policies and the MAHASAGAR or &ldquo;Mutual and Holistic Advancement for Security and Growth Across Regions&rdquo; outlook. &ldquo;It is also on the pathway to our Indo-Pacific commitment.

The email will be monitored directly by the deputy director of education, Sood said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The announcement comes amid an escalating political row over school fee hikes. The opposition Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and its leader Arvind Kejriwal have accused private schools of &ldquo;looting&rdquo; parents after the BJP took control of the Delhi government. They allege that private institutions are hiking fees indiscriminately, emboldened by the new administration.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sood, however, turned the blame back on the previous government, accusing the AAP of collusion with private school managements and failing to regulate fee increases for the past 10 years.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Though the Delhi School Education Act, 1973 requires every private school to submit its audit reports annually by March 31, only 75 schools were being audited each year during the AAP&rsquo;s tenure,&rdquo; Sood said. &ldquo;There has been no proper inspection or audit of most schools for a decade. That stops now.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the new initiative, the government will publish school-wise data on fee increases over the past few years on the Directorate of Education&rsquo;s (DoE) website within 10 days, Sood said. &ldquo;This will ensure transparency and allow parents to see for themselves whether a fee hike was justified,&rdquo; he added.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He cited several schools as examples of what he called &ldquo;rampant profiteering.&rdquo; DPS Dwarka, he said, had increased its fees by 20% in 2020, 13% in 2021, 9% in 2022, 8% in 2023, and 7% in 2024. Srijan School raised fees by 35% during the AAP regime, and hiked them again by 36% for 2024&ndash;25. Ahlcon International School, he said, was allowed to raise fees by 15% in 2022&ndash;23 despite having been flagged for financial irregularities amounting to&nbsp;\u20b915 crore. It went on to raise fees by another 13% this year.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other examples cited by the minister include Lancer&rsquo;s Convent, which allegedly hiked fees by 34% in 2024&ndash;25, Rukmini Devi Public School (11% in the same year), and Salwan Public School, which allegedly raised fees by nearly 24% in 2023&ndash;24 and another 15% in 2024&ndash;25 while under scrutiny for fund misappropriation worth&nbsp;\u20b91.68 crore.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>HT&rsquo;s repeated calls and messages to all school mentioned by the minister did not elicit any response till the time of going to print.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sood said the current government had, for the first time, launched a probe into these increases. &ldquo;The commercialisation of education will not be tolerated. We are committed to protecting parents from unjustified financial burdens,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He accused the AAP of looking the other way while schools raised fees year after year.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>AAP leader and former chief minister Atishi hit back even before Sood&rsquo;s press conference began. She challenged the BJP to impose an immediate freeze on fee hikes and have all schools audited by CAG-empanelled auditors. &ldquo;If the BJP is not hand-in-glove with private schools, why is it allowing this daylight robbery?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;For the last 10 years, we kept school fees under control, ordered audits, and ensured that parents were refunded any unjustified increase&mdash;even after students had graduated.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sood dismissed her claims and accused Atishi of presiding over a system that allowed irregularities to flourish.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Referring to a 2004 Supreme Court judgment that barred fee hikes without DoE approval, Sood noted that this requirement had been weakened by a Delhi high court ruling in 2024, which he claimed occurred during the AAP&rsquo;s watch. &ldquo;That judgment dismissed the need for schools to seek the director&rsquo;s permission before raising fees. We have filed an appeal and are working to expedite the hearings,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government&rsquo;s audit teams, Sood added, will examine 18 key financial parameters and school records to ensure accountability. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re working in the interest of parents and students. Education is not a business, and we won&rsquo;t allow it to become one,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\r\n","img":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/ht-img\/img\/2025\/04\/08\/550x309\/AAP-leader-and-former-chief-minister-Atishi-hit-ba_1744072639026.jpg","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/cities\/delhi-news\/govt-to-probe-fee-irregularities-in-1-600-pvt-schools-minister-101744072641997.html","url":"\/govt-to-probe-fee-irregularities-in-1-600-pvt-schools-minister.html","category":"Delhi","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2025-04-07T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"Jaishankar, Rubio pitch for early conclusion of the Bilateral Trade Agreement","desc":"<h2>In first call since U.S. imposed tariffs, the External Affairs Minister and the U.S. Secretary of State discuss trade and regional issues<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Amidst turbulence across global markets including in India over the tariffs announced by the U.S. administration, External Affairs Minister S.

The US is set to impose a 25% punitive tariff on Indian exports from August 28 over Russian oil purchases, which will be in addition to a 25% reciprocal tariff.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Babushkin and deputy trade commissioner Evgeny Griva, however, were confident that Russia would be able to circumvent pressure from the US and its Western allies over energy trade with India.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Despite the political situation, we can predict that the level of crude oil imports would be approximately the same,&rdquo; Griva said. &ldquo;Definitely, there are some mechanisms to supply crude oil. We can&rsquo;t discuss it because it&rsquo;s really a very special mechanism.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Babushkin added: &ldquo;This is not the first time our trade and economic relations [have been] threatened by external factors. But each and every time, we have managed to succeed in finding ways to cooperate further based on our mutual national interests. We are quite certain that our cooperation will continue.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The officials said oil supplies to Vadinar refinery in Gujarat, jointly owned by Russian energy giant Rosneft and an investment consortium, hadn&rsquo;t been impacted after it was targeted under a EU sanctions package in July. The Vadinar facility, in which Rosneft has a 49.13% stake, is India&rsquo;s second largest single-site refinery with an annual capacity of 20 million metric tonnes (MMT).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russia has a mechanism to tackle shipping and insurance-related issues due to EU sanctions and crude is supplied directly to the refinery as it is a subsidiary of Rosneft, Griva said. &ldquo;The recent package of sanctions against Russia from the EU would not have much impact on Russian oil trade because we have been able to significantly reduce our dependence on services the EU provides in recent years,&rdquo; Babushkin added.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The officials, however, acknowledged that a 5% swing is possible in oil import prices amid the Western tariffs and sanctions, though this will be subject to negotiation. They also said India and Russia were on track to achieve the target of driving bilateral trade to $100 billion by 2030, thanks to a stable growth of about 10% annually.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bilateral trade touched a record high of $68.7 billion in 2024-25, though India&rsquo;s exports were worth only $4.88 billion, and Babushkin said Russia is working to address the trade imbalance. &ldquo;We need to reduce the trade imbalance, which is currently about $60 billion. We will remove barriers to trade, facilitate interaction within business circles and give a new push to alternative logistics corridors. And we will further develop our payments and transactions mechanisms,&rdquo; Babushkin said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Against the backdrop of strident criticism of India&rsquo;s purchases of Russian weaponry and military hardware by US President Donald Trump and senior American officials, Babushkin said Russia remains the &ldquo;partner of choice for India&rdquo; in defence and pointed to the joint development of the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile since 1998.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We have dramatically expanded the programme of our joint engagements for co-production of various sophisticated weapons,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A Russian weapon is a natural choice for the Indian Army general. Operation Sindoor was a very successful battle test for the Russian systems and S-400 was one of them.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>India used both the BrahMos missile and the S-400 air defence system during Operation Sindoor, launched on May 7 to target terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan in retaliation for the Pahalgam terror attack, and the subsequent four days of hostilities between the two countries. The Russian-origin Su-30 combat jet was also used during the hostilities to fire the BrahMos missile, and a Pakistan surveillance aircraft was shot down at a distance of about 300 km by the S-400.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Babushkin said Russia is expected to be part of India&rsquo;s plans to create a new long-range air defence shield called Sudarshan Chakra, which was unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his Independence Day speech. The system, integrated with offensive weapons, is expected to be operational by 2035 to guard cities and vital infrastructure.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Babushkin noted that the S-400 is already part of India&rsquo;s air defence system and said: &ldquo;We proceed from the understanding that when it comes to the advancement of these systems, Russian equipment will be part of it.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Russian officials were speaking hours after external affairs minister S Jaishankar arrived in Moscow on Tuesday for talks with his counterpart Sergey Lavrov and to co-chair a meeting of the India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission on Trade, Economic, Scientific, Technological and Cultural Cooperation (IRIGC-TEC) with deputy prime minister Denis Manturov.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Babushkin said these engagements are part of preparations for Putin&rsquo;s planned visit later in the year for a summit with Modi. Putin also dialled Modi twice in the past fortnight to brief him on developments in Ukraine and his summit with Trump in Alaska.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two sides are working on a comprehensive agenda for the annual summit that will include trade, investments, energy cooperation, infrastructure and nuclear power, including small and modular reactors, he said.<\/p>\r\n","img":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/ht-img\/img\/2025\/08\/20\/550x309\/External-Affairs-Minister-S-Jaishankar-with-Russia_1755716441414.jpg","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/india-news\/russia-states-oil-trade-with-india-won-t-be-hit-101755716448842.html","url":"\/russia-states-oil-trade-with-india-won-t-be-hit.html","category":"India, Russia, World","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2025-08-20T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"India to export EVs to 100 countries: PM Modi","desc":"<h2>In another important announcement, PM Modi revealed that India&#39;s first domestically made semiconductor chip will be available by year-end.<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Saturday that India is going to export electric vehicles to 100 countries across the world.

In most cases, sex workers are lured into the trade through human trafficking, the court said<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Kochi:<\/strong>&nbsp;The Kerala High Court has ruled that a person availing the services of a sex worker in a brothel can be prosecuted under the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 as he\/she is inducing the sex worker to carry on prostitution by paying money.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bench of Justice VG Arun opined that a person utilising the services at a brothel cannot be termed as a &lsquo;customer&rsquo; as a sex worker was not a &lsquo;product&rsquo;. In most cases, sex workers are lured into the trade through human trafficking and compelled to offer his\/her body to satisfy the carnal pleasure of others, it stressed.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The HC made the ruling while considering the petition filed by a man who was charged under sections 3 (punishment for keeping a brothel), 4 (punishment for living partly\/wholly on the earnings of another person&rsquo;s prostitution), 5(1)(d) (inducing a person to carry on prostitution) and 7 (punishment for prostitution in or near public places) of the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act 1956.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The petitioner and a woman were found lying naked in a house in Kudappanakunnu within Peroorkada police station limits during a search by officers in March, 2021. It was found that the first two accused in the case had procured three women and inviting interested persons for the purpose of prostitution. The petitioner&rsquo;s counsel argued that he was only a customer at the brothel and could not be charged for inducing prostitution.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his ruling, Justice Arun noted that he disagreed with the reasoning of other High Courts that have ruled against penalising those availing services at a brothel under sections 5 or 7 of the Act.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;In my view, a person utilising the service of a sex worker at a brothel cannot be termed as a customer. To be a customer, a person should buy some goods or services. A sex worker cannot be denigrated as a product,&rdquo; the judge noted in his order delivered on July 21 this year.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The payment offered by such a person at a brothel can &ldquo;only be perceived as an inducement to make the sex worker offer his\/her body and act in accordance with the demands of the payer.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Thus a person availing the services of a sex worker at a brothel is actually inducing that sex worker to carry on prostitution by paying money and is therefore liable to be prosecuted for the offence under section 5(1)(d) of the Act. If the inducer is termed as a customer, that would be contrary to the object of the Act, which is intended to prevent human trafficking and not punish the persons compelled to indulge in prostitution,&rdquo; the order said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The HC bench allowed the plea in part by quashing the proceedings against the petitioner for offences under sections 3 and 4 of the Act and permitting to continue prosecution for offences under sections 5(1)(d) and 7 of the Act.<\/p>\r\n","img":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/ht-img\/img\/2025\/09\/09\/550x309\/The-Kerala-High-Court-has-ruled-that-a-person-avai_1757447524067.jpg","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/india-news\/soliciting-in-a-brothel-can-lead-to-prosecution-says-kerala-hc-101757447530868.html","url":"\/soliciting-in-a-brothel-can-lead-to-prosecution-says-kerala-hc.html","category":"Kerala","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2025-09-09T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"UPI may soon allow transactions from 192 countries, new project to\u2026","desc":"<h2>If rolled out successfully, the UPI&ndash;UPU integration could mark one of the largest expansions of India&rsquo;s digital payment system.<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In a significant step towards revolutionising cross-border money transfers, Union Minister for Communications and Development of North Eastern Region, Jyotiraditya Scindia, today unveiled the UPI&ndash;UPU Integration Project at the 28th Universal Postal Congress in Dubai.

Over the years, he dropped &ldquo;Rudra&rdquo; and began presenting himself as Dr Swami Parthasarthy before finally styling himself as Swami Chaintanyanada Saraswati.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Officials said they believe that these shifts were not merely cosmetic, but deliberate attempts to mislead organisations he worked with and to access new opportunities.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>After leaving Siliguri, Saraswati lived in Kolkata and Odisha before moving to Delhi around 2000, according to a senior police officer. He initially associated himself with the Ramakrishna Math, working there for four to five years. Police said he served under a senior figure at the Ramakrishna Mission and was later sent to head an ashram in Ernakulam, Kerala.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>His stint there, however, ended in controversy. &ldquo;However, he was asked to leave the Ramakrishna Math in 2001-02 after the organisation found that he was allegedly manipulating accounts of the ashram in Kerala,&rdquo; the officer said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 2009-10, Saraswati became associated with the Sri Sri Jagadguru Shankaracharya Mahasamthanam Dakshinamnya Sri Sharada Peetham. It was through this association that he was appointed chairman of the Sri Sharada Institute of Indian Management-Research in Vasant Kunj, the probe has shown.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then the Peetham itself later filed a case against him earlier this year, accusing him of fraud. In an FIR lodged on July 23, the organisation alleged that Saraswati possessed two passports, each with different details. One listed his father as Dayananda Saraswati and mother as Sharadha Ambal. A newspaper clipping about his name change, however, identified his father as Swami Gahananandji Puri.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The contradictions also extended to his place of birth. An expired passport listed Darjeeling, West Bengal, while a newer document cited Thiruvelikani in Tamil Nadu. To complicate matters further, a journal published by a trust he allegedly set up described him as a citizen of the US, the FIR.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several students told HT that Saraswati frequently claimed to be both a US citizen and a United Nations member. &ldquo;These conflicting records show his intent to dupe institutions and individuals,&rdquo; police said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Peetham also accused him of creating a&nbsp;\u20b9122 crore trust fund using diverted money and producing fake lease deeds, causing financial losses to the organisation.<\/p>\r\n","img":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/ht-img\/img\/2025\/09\/29\/550x309\/Chaitanyananda-was-sent-to-five-days--police-custo_1759172396407_1759187575355.jpg","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/india-news\/swami-chaintanyanada-held-multiple-identities-over-decades-police-101759187389861.html","url":"\/swami-chaintanyanada-held-multiple-identities-over-decades-police.html","category":"West Bengal","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2025-09-29T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"Karnataka Minister Parameshwara urges SIT to complete Dharmasthala probe at earliest","desc":"<h2>Karnataka Minister Parameshwara urges SIT to complete Dharmasthala probe at earliest<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Bengaluru, Sept 30 Karnataka Home Minister G Parameshwara on Tuesday said the government directed the Special Investigation Team probing allegations of &ldquo;multiple murders, rapes and burials&rdquo; in Dharmasthala to complete the investigation at the earliest.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also said the Forensic Science Laboratory reports in connection with the case are pending.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking to reporters, Parameshwara said, &quot;SIT is doing its job.

According to the publiction, the concept is under discussion, not yet enforced. The report noted that the tax remains in the &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; stage, pending further feasibility and implementation planning.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not Bengaluru&rsquo;s first brush with congestion tax ideas. As far back as 2023, a committee under Karnataka&rsquo;s &ldquo;Vision $1 Trillion Economy&rdquo; had suggested instituting a congestion charge on vehicles entering the city during peak hours to reduce traffic and raise revenue. Moneycontrol explained that the earlier proposal would have applied across nine arterial entry roads: Bellary Road, Mysuru Road, Old Madras Road, Hosur Road, Kanakapura Road, Mysore Road, Bannerghatta Road, Tumakuru Road, and Magadi Road.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What could improve<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Reduced traffic congestion along critical stretches such as ORR and busy arterial roads<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Encouragement for shared travel (carpooling) and use of public transport<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additional revenue that could be earmarked for improving infrastructure or transit systems<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Demand management: discouraging unnecessary car trips during peak periods<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts warn Bengaluru is not yet equipped with a strong enough public transport network to absorb displaced private vehicle users.

Some say it would burden those who have no choice but to use a car due to gaps in transit coverage.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Technical, legal, and administrative complexities: ensuring accurate vehicle tracking, determining boundaries for taxed zones, exemptions, and real-time enforcement, all are major tasks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Political resistance is expected, especially from motorists, middle-class commuters, and those opposed to new levies in the absence of visible infrastructure gains.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the proposal goes through, solo drivers entering designated congested zones during certain hours would incur an extra charge, automatically deducted via FASTag.

The bill - proposed by Republican Senator Chuck Grassley and Democratic Senator Dick Durbin - aims to &ldquo;target visa fraud and abuse&rdquo; and provide &ldquo;protections for American workers&rdquo;. However, it is unclear if the bill will become law given that most immigration reform legislation introduced in US Congress has failed over the last decade.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Major companies are laying off thousands of American workers while filing thousands of visa petitions for foreign workers at depressed wages and poor working conditions. Congress must step in to protect American workers and fix our broken immigration system. Senator Grassley and I will work to make this bipartisan bill the law of the land,&rdquo; Senator Durbin said in a statement.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This development comes just weeks after US President Donald Trump announced a $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications. Trump&rsquo;s announcement --which the White House said was motivated by &ldquo;systemic&rdquo; abuse of the H-1B visa programme --is expected to make it uneconomical for US companies to hire foreign workers. US immigration agencies have also announced plans to rejig the H-1B visa lottery to favour higher paid workers. The US department of Labour also launched Operation Firewall, an enforcement effort to crack down on fraud and misuse of the H-1B programme.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>These policy decisions will impact thousands of Indian professionals in America on work visas, according to immigration lawyers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new bill - christened the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act - is expected to make foreign hiring harder.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;These changes would increase compliance requirements and likely make H-1B hiring more expensive, particularly for companies that have relied on lower wage levels or contract-based staffing. For L-1 visas, which are used for transferring employees within multinational companies, the bill closes existing gaps by limiting outplacement, raising oversight standards, and adding wage and displacement safeguards,&rdquo; said Nicole Gunara, Principal Immigration Attorney at Manifest Law. Gunara added that the new bill will make it harder to use L1 visas, which will push more companies towards traditional, direct employment.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What is important to remember is that just 5% of more than 300 immigration bills proposed between 2015 to 2024 became law, so this is a very early stage,&rdquo; Gunara tells HT.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The H-1B visa programme in its current form was introduced in 1990 as a pathway for workers in specialty occupations to fill crucial shortages in the US economy. The H-1B is granted for a period of three years, which can then be extended by another three years. Thousands of Indian professionals have used H1B as a pathway to work and eventually settle down in the United States.Over 70% of approved H1B visas go to professionals from India, who will be disproportionately affected by the new visa application hike.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indian companies like Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services are among the top 10 sponsors of H1B visas. Meanwhile, the L1 is used by multinational companies - including IT services firms from India - to transfer managers and executives from foreign branches to a related US office for a specified period.<\/p>\r\n","img":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/ht-img\/img\/2025\/09\/30\/550x309\/Senator-Chuck-Grassley--left--and-senator-Dick-Dur_1759257081821.jpg","redirect_url":"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/world-news\/us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-to-change-h-1b-l-1-system-101759257088793.html","url":"\/us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-to-change-h-1b-l-1-system.html","category":"United States","show_below_nav_banner":"true","show_in_home_carousel":"true","date":"2025-09-30T18:30:00+00:00"},{"title":"Trumps fresh claim on Nobel Peace Prize ahead of Oct 10 announcement: They will give it to\u2026","desc":"<h2>Trump&rsquo;s latest bid for the Peace Prize comes a day after he unveiled the Gaza peace plan, which could become the eighth conflict he claims to have mediated.<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said it would be an &quot;insult&quot; to his country if he does not receive the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/topic\/nobel-peace-prize\" target=\"_blank\">Nobel Peace Prize<\/a>&nbsp;for his self-proclaimed role in ending at least seven international conflicts.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest claim to the Nobel Peace Prize comes a day after Trump&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/world-news\/what-are-the-20-points-in-trumps-gaza-peace-plan-101759177097782.html\" target=\"_blank\">announced the Gaza peace plan<\/a>, which, if accepted by Hamas, could be the eighth war the US President has claimed to have mediated.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Will you get the Nobel Prize?
