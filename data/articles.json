Those adjustments allow birds to cut through the sky more nimbly than rigid drones. Now, using new insights into exactly how pigeons joints control the spread of their wing feathers, researchers have built a robotic pigeon, dubbed <strong>PigeonBot<\/strong>, whose feathered wings change shape like the real deal<\/p><p>This research paves the way for creating more agile aircraft, says <strong>Dario Floreano, a roboticist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne in Switzerland<\/strong> not involved in the work.<\/p><p>With birdlike wings, airborne machines could make tighter turns in cluttered spaces, such as around buildings or in forests, and could better navigate rough air, Floreano says (SN: 1\/24\/15). The new robot, described January 16 in Science Robotics, also offers a way to study the nuts and bolts of bird flight without animal experiments.<\/p><p>Researchers bent and extended the wings of dead pigeons to investigate how the birds control their wing shape. Those experiments revealed that the angles of two wing joints, the wrist and the finger, most affect the alignment of a wings flight feathers. The orientations of those long, stiff feathers, which support the bird in flight, help determine the wings shape. Based on those findings, the team built a robot with real pigeon feathers, whose faux wrists and fingers can morph its wing shape as seen in the pigeon cadavers.<\/p><p>Besides laying the groundwork for building more graceful drones, whats really cool about this robot is  you can make manipulations in a robot wing that you could never do or want to do in a bird to study flight, says <strong>David Lentink, an engineer and biologist at Stanford University.<\/strong><\/p><p>For instance, Lentink wondered whether a pigeon could steer itself just by bending the finger joint of either its left or right wing. The problem is, of course, I dont really know how to train a bird to just move its finger  and I actually am very good in bird training, he says by phone, as two pet birds chirp in the background.<\/p><p>A controllable robotic pigeon solves that problem. In flight tests, Lentinks team observed that bending only the finger of one wing eased the robot into a banked turn  offering the first evidence that birds may sometimes use just their fingers to steer in flight.<\/p><p>In a second study, reported in the Jan. 17 Science, Lentinks group used their robotic wing design to confirm another insight into bird flight: how gaps are prevented from forming between feathers on extended wings. In experiments that involved rubbing one bird feather across the top of another  to mimic overlapping flight feathers fanning out  researchers found that two feathers initially slid apart easily, but then snagged on each other. Scanning electron and X-ray microscopy images revealed that tiny hooks protruding from the top of one feather latch onto ridges on the underside of the other when they slide too far apart. Those microscopic hooks unfasten when the feathers slot back together.<\/p><p><strong>Thats the secret. They have this directional Velcro that holds feathers together<\/strong>, Lentink says.<\/p><p>To confirm the effect of these microstructures, the researchers rotated the feathers on their robot so that they wouldnt slide against each other when wings were extended. In wind tunnel and outdoor flight tests, gaps formed between feathers on the modified robot wings, undermining the wings stability.<\/p><p>This is the best set of robotic wings yet for testing how birds coordinate their flight feathers to maneuver through the air, says Tyson Hedrick, a biomechanist the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill not involved in the work. But theres plenty of room for improvement. For instance, a future flying robot could include a shoulder joint, to investigate how tilting a birds wings up and down influences flight, he says.<\/p>","type":"Social Media","category":"Sci-Tech","banner394x449":"upload\/banner394x449\/public\/pigeon-bot_feat.jpg","banner600x500":"upload\/banner600x500\/public\/pigeon-bot_feat.jpg","banner788x443":"upload\/banner788x443\/public\/pigeon-bot_feat.jpg","banner800x460":"upload\/banner800x460\/public\/pigeon-bot_feat.jpg","file":"2020-05-31-PigeonBot-is-the-first-robot-that-can-bend-its-wings.json"},{"title":"Scientists Have Created Hexagonal Salt, For First Time Ever","created":"01 Jun, 2020","updated":"2022-12-01T08:00:00+05:30","author":"Karthik Kumar D K","views":"463","summary":"While it probably won't make it to your dining table, a new scientific achievement might be able to help in everything from radar equipment to electric cars: scientists have been able to form salt, aka sodium chloride (NaCl), in a hexagonal shape","content":"<p>While it probably won't make it to your dining table, a new scientific achievement might be able to help in everything from radar equipment to electric cars: <strong>scientists have been able to form salt, aka sodium chloride (NaCl), in a hexagonal shape<\/strong><\/p><p>This is work done at the smallest of scales, with researchers able to get a thin film of hexagonal salt to form on top of a layer of diamond, due to the chemical interaction of both film and diamond substrate - something the team actually predicted would happen in advance through simulations.<\/p><p>It's the latest in a series of discoveries where scientists have been <strong>able to synthesise 2D materials with unusual crystal structures<\/strong>, and it's partly this self-imposed restriction to two dimensions that is enabling new and exotic structures to be formed.<\/p><p>\"Initially we decided to perform only a computational study of the formation of new 2D structures on different substrates, driven by the hypothesis that if a substrate interacts strongly with the NaCl thin film, one can expect major changes in the structure of the thin film,\" says material scientist Kseniya Tikhomirova from the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech) in Russia.<\/p><p>\"<strong>Indeed, we obtained very interesting results and predicted the formation of a hexagonal NaCl film on the diamond substrate<\/strong>, and decided to perform experiments.

Its difficult, if you are not sure what level of openness is fine or not. This actually depends upon your past experiences, and the person whom you communicate too.<\/p>\n                                <p>You generally share your most intimate stuff with your romatic partners, <strong>you will tend to create or already have a special bond<\/strong>, thats unique and only one to say. This is the one which creates strong attachment, a sense of trust & a sense of that partner belongs to you.<\/p>\n                                \n                                <h3>What if I hold back?<\/h3>\n                                <p>Here is the relationship starts suffering, when we are holding back. Yes we have right, to have privacy and secrets to ourself, but this is the point where we start loosing the trust, Emotionally we might not be able to show up, It might lead to decrease in the intimacy levels with partner. Its nearly impossible to feel connected.<\/p>\n                                <h3>Why do you want to hold back?<\/h3>\n                                <p>Their could be many reasons, may be you have shared something in the past and did not felt safe. This is not something you have to be worried or feared about, You have to move towards more trusting ways so that you can open up to experience the emotional feel of connection.<\/p>\n                                <h3>Why will I keep it private?<\/h3>\n                                <p>Keeping private is very individuals choice, It is really not required to share every thought, feeling or an experience. Healthy Adult relationship between couple will be more like have each others space and respect each others privacy.<\/p>\n                                \n                                <h3>What is the difference?

A must watch movie.<\/p>\n                                <p>Their are many lines in the movie by the characters, which tells about Life, Hope and Freedom. In this article, I'm gona list of few of them.<\/p>\n                                <h4><sup><i class=\"fa fa-quote-left\"><\/i><\/sup> Thats The Beauty Of Music.

In the story plot he would have got this music cd along with the books which he requested for. And all people in the prison for a while senses their soul of freedom. And he get punished by warden for the same.<\/p>\n                                <p>But, If we understand why he did this? Andy is saying, hope can't be taken away from him by the prison which is exactly what music represents. Which is the theme of entire film.<\/p>\n                                <h4><sup><i class=\"fa fa-quote-left\"><\/i><\/sup> Every Man Has His Breaking Point <sup><i class=\"fa fa-quote-right\"><\/i><\/sup><\/h4>\n                                <p>We see Red stating this dialog, just before Andy's escape from the prison.<\/p>\n                                <p>Friends of Red and Andy were taking how Andy went through solitary confinement and Andy took a six feet rope from one of his front. They were talking, Andy might end up like Brooks. But as a twist in the movie, Andy escapes prison by digging wall, which Red had taught it would 600 years to dig with small hammer.<\/p>\n                                <p>If we take a look at this sentence once again. Red was regaining hope for life. But Andy didn't lost hope and he for preparing for freedom. And Red regains hope, we can see it while Red go up for third time parole and get's out of Prison. He can't leave the country though.<\/p>\n                                <h4><sup><i class=\"fa fa-quote-left\"><\/i><\/sup> They send you here for life, and that's exactly what they take. <sup><i class=\"fa fa-quote-right\"><\/i><\/sup><\/h4>\n                                <p>Andy says this to Red, while he has a first proper communication after few days in prison. At the end of the movie, if we re-call we understand that Andy didn't loose hope and he started to play Red for his Freedom at this time itself.<\/p>\n                                <h4><sup><i class=\"fa fa-quote-left\"><\/i><\/sup> The world went and got itself in a big damn hurry. <sup><i class=\"fa fa-quote-right\"><\/i><\/sup><\/h4>\n                                <p>World would look very different for a person like Brooks, who spent roughly 50 years in the prison. Who hangs himself later, who has lost the hope, he never got freedom as well.<\/p>\n                                <p>Brooks would be writing letters to his friends who are still at prison. We understand that, Its nice we got freedom from prison, but their are many things like prison walls outside as well.<\/p>\n                                <h4><sup><i class=\"fa fa-quote-left\"><\/i><\/sup> Get busy living, or get busy dying <sup><i class=\"fa fa-quote-right\"><\/i><\/sup><\/h4>\n                                <p>In the story, Red writes this line about breaking his parole and going to Mexico.<\/p>\n                                <p>This line very clear, Either you wait for something to happen or you make something to happen for yourself.

You need to detail analysis of exisiting code, like in and out of the code and come up with the solution diagram kid of stuff.. which would help other team members. And you should be ready with segregating code like which piece to go where or sub modules or any independent libraries or any common code.<\/p>\n                                <h4>Check, was their any code dependent on third party applications<\/h4>\n                                <p>Also it pretty important to check if any code is dependent on third party applications, like API is returing the data to be used on the drupal application or any such similar case.<\/p>\n                                <p>This is a brief of Audit to start with on Drupal 7 to Drupal 8\/9, I'll be writing in detail of each in further articles.

There are two kinds of headers: those that are vulnerable, and those that are secure.<\/p>\n                                <h3>HTTP Header Vulnerable vs Secured..?<\/h3>\n                                <p>To note, the less information you expose on the Internet, the less data a penetration tester or real malicious attacker will find.<\/p>\n                                <p>Let's look at two examples, a vulnerable HTTP header vs a hardened HTTP header.<\/p>\n                                <h5>1.

Enable X-Content-Type-Options<\/h4>\n                                <p>You can ensure the browser will render the data as original, and not as any other by adding the X-Content-Type-Options.<\/p>\n                                <p><code>add_header X-Content-Type-Options \"nosniff\" always;<\/code><\/p>\n                                <h4>6. Enable X-Frame-Options<\/h4>\n                                <p>In case, if Iframes are used then clickjacking attacks can be done, with this sensitive data from users can be stolen.

Enable Referrer Policy<\/h4>\n                                <p>Referrer Policy allows you to control what information can be included in the Referrer header while navigating from pages on your site. By doing this makes it impossible to track these requests while navigating away from your site.<\/p>\n                                <p><code>add_header Referrer-Policy \"origin-when-cross-origin\" always;<\/code><\/p>\n                                <h4>8. Control Resources and Limits<\/h4>\n                                <p>To prevent potential DoS attacks on nginx, you can set buffer size limitations for all clients.<\/p>\n                                <p><pre>client_body_buffer_size 1k\nclient_header_buffer_size 1k\nclient_max_body_size 1k\nlarge_client_header_buffers 2 1k<\/pre><\/p>\n                                <h4>9. Configure SSL and Cipher Suites<\/h4>\n                                <p>Default configuration of nginx will use insecure old versions of the TLS protocol. This may lead to attacks such as the BEAST attack. So you can configure nginx to have TLSv1.2 or v1.3.<\/p>\n                                <p>Additionally, you should specify cipher suites to make sure that no vulnerable suites are supported.<\/p>\n                                <p><pre>ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;\nssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;<\/pre><\/p>\n                                <p>So, by having such response headers configured on the web server, we can make sure the website is not prone to vulnerabilities and be safe from attacks.<\/p>","type":"Drupal","category":"Security,Sci-Tech","banner394x449":"upload\/banner394x449\/public\/nginx-drupal.png","banner600x500":"upload\/banner600x500\/public\/nginx-drupal.png","banner788x443":"upload\/banner788x443\/public\/nginx-drupal.png","banner800x460":"upload\/banner800x460\/public\/nginx-drupal.png","file":"2021-06-20-11-Security-Hardening-Nginx-Response-Headers.json"},{"title":"Why to have a Green Roof or Eco Friendly Roof on a Building","created":"22 Jun, 2021","updated":"2022-12-01T08:00:00+05:30","author":"Karthik Kumar D K","views":"463","summary":"A roof of a building that is partially or completely covered with vegetation, that is planted over a waterproofing membrane.

In some cases the assumptions made might not be having an actual solution while implementing it. Or in some cases assumptions would be made only for the best cases.<\/p>\n                            <p>Experts came up with a term called Planning Fallacy, which is a bias that humans have of being overly optimistic.<\/p>\n                            <p>They suggest that planning fallacy would happen as a result of a habit of assuming the best case scenario and ignoring the historical data. And this can affect all parts of the estimation in a project.<\/p>\n                            <h3>What to consider while estimating?<\/h3>\n                            <p>To get the better estimation on a project, you have to provide your client with a picture of what work or scope is there in the project. So to do this, you have to consider below ones<\/p>\n                            <ul class=\"check\">\n                                <li>Effort estimation<\/li>\n                                <li>Cost estimation<\/li>\n                                <li>Resource estimation<\/li>\n                                <li>Time estimation<\/li>\n                            <\/ul>\n                            <h4>1. Effort estimation<\/h4>\n                            <p>Effort estimation pretty much includes everything from time, capacity, skill needed & resources available. We need to get the effort needed for a project to get a high-level picture at the early stages of the project.<\/p>\n                            <h4>2. Cost estimation<\/h4>\n                            <p>Cost estimation is also important to run the project efficiently, and you can ensure the client or stakeholder that you have needed a budget to complete the project. And it's important to get this data at an early stage of the project lifecycle.<\/p>\n                            <div class=\"google-ad\">\n                                <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\"\n                                     style=\"display:block; text-align:center;\"\n                                     data-ad-layout=\"in-article\"\n                                     data-ad-format=\"fluid\"\n                                     data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2683569506254139\"\n                                     data-ad-slot=\"4812668708\"><\/ins>\n                                <script>\n                                    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n                                <\/script>\n                            <\/div>\n                            <h4>3. Resource estimation<\/h4>\n                            <p>You have to plan for all the resources including people, tools, softwares, hardwares, any licences etc. You have to make sure when & how much resources are needed at a single point of time.<\/p>\n                            <h4>4. Time estimation<\/h4>\n                            <p>You should get a defined schedule, which has a buffer time with all the milestones estimated. Ideally preparing a Project schedule will get you a better picture. And by this you will be able to indicate clients or stakeholders when they can see results.<\/p>\n                            <h3>Why do estimates go long?<\/h3>\n                            <p>Generally estimating a project itself will take nearly 30% of the project's entire time span. And yes this long time is needed, to get a better & proper plan, which includes creating all planning doc\u2019s & a proper project management plan.<\/p>\n                            <h3>And few approaches for estimating!<\/h3>\n                            <p>There are few approaches used by project managers for project estimation and they make sure to keep this process very agile so that it's easy to manage. Below are the few approaches.<\/p>\n                            <ul class=\"check\">\n                                <li>Top-Down approach<\/li>\n                                <li>Bottom-Up approach<\/li>\n                                <li>Analogous approach<\/li>\n                                <li>Parametric approach<\/li>\n                                <li>Three-point approach<\/li>\n                                <li>What-If analysis<\/li>\n                            <\/ul>\n                            <p>Will detail it out about the above mentioned approaches in the future article.<\/p>\n                            <p>So, project estimation is really necessary for project planning.

The templating system in all previous versions of Drupal is using <code>theme_*<\/code> functions and PHP-based <code>*.tpl.php<\/code> files. Now, this has been completely replaced in Drupal 8. Instead of using theme functions and theme template files, Drupal is now using the Twig templating system.<\/p>\n                            <p>Twig is a <strong>PHP-based compiled templating language<\/strong>. When your web page renders, the Twig engine takes the template and converts it into a 'compiled' PHP template which is stored in a protected directory in <code>sites\/default\/files\/php\/twig<\/code>.

But at the same time, if any template engine is solving some problems and gives developers a better experience, then that would be a good choice for any framework like Drupal to have.<\/p>\n                            <p>Below are a few points put out which we can take as improvements in a template engine compared to plain PHP templates.<\/p>\n                            <h4>1. Syntax in template engine<\/h4>\n                            <p>Drupal 8 will be accessing all the variables very consistently like <code>{{ node.nid }}<\/code> or <code>{{ node_url }}<\/code>, wherein Drupal 7 we have multiple ways to print a particular variable, including strings, objects & arrays.<\/p>\n                            <div class=\"google-ad\">\n                                <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\"\n                                     style=\"display:block; text-align:center;\"\n                                     data-ad-layout=\"in-article\"\n                                     data-ad-format=\"fluid\"\n                                     data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2683569506254139\"\n                                     data-ad-slot=\"4812668708\"><\/ins>\n                                <script>\n                                    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n                                <\/script>\n                            <\/div>\n                            <h4>2. Inconsistency in PHP templates<\/h4>\n                            <p>In Drupal 7 we can use template files and at the same time, we can use the functions to render. Sometimes it becomes harder to understand already written code or the Core code (without documentation) & also we see difficulties in overriding the code. But Drupal 8 only uses template files.<\/p>\n                            <h4>3. Redundancy while writing code<\/h4>\n                            <p>In Drupal 8 we can use the existing template, like using extends, which is a kind of proper inheritance and by this, we can eliminate the duplicate code. But in Drupal 7 we have multiple files with similar code.<\/p>\n                            <h4>4. Sanitize data<\/h4>\n                            <p>Using template engines like Twig, we can automatically sanitize the data which is to be rendered. So there would be no way to have any unsafe functions like in Drupal earlier version like in Drupal 7 we can print the unsanitized data to render & even we would be able to do database queries. Here Twig is responsible for sanitizing data.<\/p>\n                            <h4>5. Caching<\/h4>\n                            <p>And also handling of caches are improved in Drupal when compared to earlier versions (which is discussed in this article), which will keep any template engine at top of its performance.<\/p>\n                            <p>Overall, Drupal as a framework now has moved to a more efficient and optimized way of rendering a site\u2019s theme through the use of Twig.<\/p>","type":"Drupal","category":"Twig,Php,Web,Sci-Tech","banner600x500":"upload\/banner600x500\/public\/drupal-twig.png","banner788x443":"upload\/banner788x443\/public\/drupal-twig.png","file":"2021-08-14-16-Understand-why-Twig-is-replacing-PHP-Template-in-Drupal.json"},{"title":"Know why Symfony framework was picked by Drupal","created":"22 Aug, 2021","updated":"2022-12-01T08:00:00+05:30","author":"Karthik Kumar D K","views":"463","summary":"Drupal made a step forward by building Drupal core using Symfony components, to meet the developers expectations.

On fresh drupal installation you can see the Breakpoint module already enabled which will help the admin toolbar to be responsive.<\/p><p>Breakpoint module will provide the ability to make the site <strong>change at different screen sizes<\/strong>.

Now this module is the same as a Responsive image module. And there is still configuration that must be set up for the Responsive image module, but unlike Breakpoint there is a user interface to do your configuration. <\/p><p>These are responsive design benifits would be available from the Drupal Core.

This happens when the other person leaves us or stops talking to us or goes away or does not love us anymore for some reason or the other.<\/p>  <p>So, choosing what type of love we show towards others might bring us more understanding about ourselves which will further enhance our ability to deal with others.<\/p>","type":"Friend","category":"Life,Lifestyle","banner600x500":"upload\/banners\/unconditional-love.jpeg","banner788x443":"upload\/banners\/unconditional-love.jpeg","file":"2022-06-01-21-unconditional-love.json"},{"title":"Drupal Configuration management (Local, Dev, Test and Live)","created":"04 Jun, 2022","updated":"2022-12-01T08:00:00+05:30","author":"Karthik Kumar D K","views":"463","summary":"Making the configurations directly in the higher environment is not recommended, every configuration should go to a higher environment via code change (which is maintained in version control).","content":"<p>In this article we are going to see how Drupal serves configurations across the environments, which can be well maintained with help of some contributed modules and version control.<\/p>  <p>Drupal 8 onwards configuration has been saved in the yml files in a consistent manner, which includes all the enabled modules, all the content types, vocabularies, fields &amp; views.<\/p>  <p>Making the configurations directly in the higher environment is not recommended, every configuration should go to a higher environment via code change (which is maintained in version control).<\/p>  <p>Drupal core provides the feature to import, export &amp; synchronise the configurations.

And it&#39;s done by modifying some lines of code within your <code>services.yml<\/code> file which will be located at <code>sites\/default\/services.yml<\/code>, as shown below.<\/p>  <p><code>parameters:<br \/> &nbsp;&nbsp;twig.config:<br \/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;debug: true<\/code><\/p>  <p>By default, you can see the value set to <code>false<\/code>, you need to set it to <code>true<\/code>.<\/p>  <p>Once you do this and rebuild the caches, you can see the existing template suggestion on inspecting the web page locally.<\/p>  <p>Now you have to write the code to alter the template suggestions, which will give you more control to create the twig template files.<\/p>  <p>And Drupal provides hooks to do this, and hook_theme_suggestions_HOOK_alter is the hook which does the purpose.<\/p>  <p>Let&rsquo;s take an example to alter the template suggestions of the taxonomy term page, and with the below code you can do it.<\/p>  <div class='google-ad'>     <ins class='adsbygoogle'          style='display:block; text-align:center;'          data-ad-layout='in-article'          data-ad-format='fluid'          data-ad-client='ca-pub-2683569506254139'          data-ad-slot='4812668708'><\/ins>     <script>         (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     <\/script> <\/div>  <p><code>use Drupal\\taxonomy\\TermInterface;<br \/> \/**<br \/> &nbsp;* Implements hook_theme_suggestions_HOOK_alter().<br \/> &nbsp;*\/<br \/> function mytheme_theme_suggestions_taxonomy_term_alter(&amp;$suggestions, $variables) {<br \/> &nbsp;&nbsp;$elements = $variables[&#39;elements&#39;];<br \/> &nbsp;&nbsp;if (isset($elements[&#39;#taxonomy_term&#39;]) &amp;&amp; isset($elements[&#39;#theme&#39;]) &amp;&amp; isset($elements[&#39;#view_mode&#39;])) {<br \/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$term = $elements[&#39;#taxonomy_term&#39;];<br \/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if ($term instanceof TermInterface) {<br \/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$suggestions[] = $elements[&#39;#theme&#39;] . &#39;__&#39; . $term-&gt;bundle() . &#39;__&#39; . $elements[&#39;#view_mode&#39;];<br \/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$suggestions[] = $elements[&#39;#theme&#39;] . &#39;__&#39; . $term-&gt;id() . &#39;__&#39; . $elements[&#39;#view_mode&#39;];<br \/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br \/> &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br \/> }<\/code><\/p>  <p>Once you write this code in your <code>.theme<\/code> file, and rebuild the caches. You can see the template suggestions on inspect of the page.<\/p>  <p>Similarly you can do for all the other pages or entities like User, Node, Media, Paragraph or a View.<\/p>  <p>Now reading the data to the templates will be a crucial or difficult part, in case you have not built your configuration at its best. What this means is,<\/p>  <ol> <li>For example, people should make sure to use the form modes and view modes of the content type, and importantly only the needed data should be passed to the form modes or view modes.<\/li> <li>Also, if you want to render just the Image URL, make sure the field from the view mode is returning just the Image URL.<\/li> <li>Don&#39;t preprocess the data, it would be a very rare case where you need to use preprocess hooks in your .theme file.<\/li> <li>If you are using a data preprocessor, it means your application is not well planned, which means you are good to make some corrections in the application.<\/li> <li>And one must make sure not to load any data from the database on the .theme file or twig file, because you are already on the rendering layer.<\/li> <\/ol>  <p>To conclude, the approach or inputs provided in the article will help drupal people to understand how they can work with twig templates.<\/p>","type":"Drupal","category":"Twig,Php,Sci-Tech","banner600x500":"upload\/banners\/how-to-work-with-twig-templates-in-drupal.png","banner788x443":"upload\/banners\/how-to-work-with-twig-templates-in-drupal.png","file":"2022-06-24-19-how-to-work-with-twig-templates-in-drupal.json"},{"title":"Dal Bhat Recipe - Nepali Style","created":"29 Jun, 2022","updated":"2022-12-01T08:00:00+05:30","author":"Reddamma D","views":"463","summary":"Dal Bhat or Nepali Dal Bhat, is a dish made of lentils and rice, actually It is considered that this is the national dish of Nepal.

Pull them up carefully or loosen up the roots to remove. Try to get all the weed roots so that it doesn&#39;t affect the plant growth. Else it will create lesser growth of plants.<\/li> <li>As the tomato plants grow, they need a stick for support, have a stick of 4-5 feet and put it in the container. Tie the stem of the plant to the stick loosely.<\/li> <li>Once you see the flowers in the plant, and after 2-4 days the flowers will lead to the pollination process, generally pollination will happen because if wind or bees, in case if you don&rsquo;t see this happening, you can always make it yourself, by just shaking the flowers gently so that pollination will start.<\/li> <li>Generally tomato plants will produce tomatoes in around 35 - 55 days post the transplantation. During this process, you can fertilize every 18-20 days, with chicken manure, fish meal, manure vermicompost or other organic fertilizer.<\/li> <li>Check soil moisture regularly and water your plants whenever soil feels dry. Make sure it&#39;s not too wet, too wet leaves cause fungus or encourage disease to plant.<\/li> <li>Around 70-80 days you can see big sized tomatoes which are green in color. At this stage Pest management is needed, spray the plant every 6-7 days with the homemade pesticide from garlic extract, chili extract and neem oil. (for half ltr water, add 30 ml of neem oil, 20 ml of garlic extract and 20 ml of chili extract)<\/li> <li>Provide extra support to the stem, while the tomatoes are bigger in size.<\/li> <li>Around 80-90 days you can see the tomatoes turning into red color.<\/li> <\/ul>  <div class='google-ad'>     <ins class='adsbygoogle'          style='display:block; text-align:center;'          data-ad-layout='in-article'          data-ad-format='fluid'          data-ad-client='ca-pub-2683569506254139'          data-ad-slot='5228875751'><\/ins>     <script>         (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     <\/script> <\/div>  <p><strong>Harvesting?<\/strong><\/p>  <ul> <li>Wait for the tomatoes to turn red, ideally check daily after 90-95 days, the tomatoes will be getting ripe.<\/li> <li>Gently twist the tomato and it will come out of the plant.<\/li> <li>In case multiple tomatoes are ripped and you can take bunch of tomatoes at once by cutting the stem of the tomatoes (where 4-5 tomatoes are linked to that particle stem)<\/li> <li>A fully ripe tomato will be a bit soft, but in either case around 95-110 days the tomatoes can be harvested.<\/li> <\/ul>  <p><strong>Other things to note during the process?<\/strong><\/p>  <ul> <li>Make sure to add water multiple times during the hotter days, in case you see it&#39;s dry.<\/li> <li>In regards to pesticide, it&#39;s really not needed, you can add pests in case you see any fungal or disease.<\/li> <\/ul>  <p>Here&rsquo;s the findings of how to grow tomatoes at your home and this will be helpful for people who wish to grow their food and for people who have time for growing at home.

If you are an overthinker or a person who thinks to take precautions for the future, then you will know exactly how it goes. Generally a problem comes to your mind, for example a worry or health or a problem at work or some sort of issue in a relationship, because of the thoughts you will be thinking about it a lot and you will try to get a solution for this as soon as possible and you will be overthinking it.<\/p>  <p>Actually, when we spend too much time thinking of thoughts, we mostly end up with the same situation of where we started.<\/p>  <p>And sometimes, people&rsquo;s overthinking can result in trouble concentrating on other stuff and this can become a cycle of overthinking and may lead to serious concerns.<\/p>  <p>After reading a few articles and watching a few videos, I have found a few common strategies to calm down and come out of overthinking and to stop overthinking.<\/p>  <ol> <li>Plan too much<\/li> <li>Change your activity<\/li> <li>Constantly look out for problems<\/li> <li>Focus on problem solving<\/li> <\/ol>  <p><strong>1. Plan too much<\/strong><\/p>  <ul> <li>Plan too much means, plan really too many possible ways for a problem which you think, it exists or it might come in the future.<\/li> <li>If you are having too many plans like Plan A, Plan B going on Plan Z or more, then you will have a solution for your problem.<\/li> <li>Good advantage of having many plans is, our mind will be busy preparing plans and will not get stuck on thinking about problems.<\/li> <li>In many cases, the other Plans might be helpful in sorting out some other problem in your future.<\/li> <li>For example you have many plans for your financial stability for your future like Savings, Inherited income, Active earnings and Passive earnings. Means these are the different plans which you have. In case you are not having Active incomes and Out of Savings, then your Inherited income and Passive earnings will keep you out of the problem.<\/li> <\/ul>  <div class='google-ad'>     <ins class='adsbygoogle'          style='display:block; text-align:center;'          data-ad-layout='in-article'          data-ad-format='fluid'          data-ad-client='ca-pub-2683569506254139'          data-ad-slot='4812668708'><\/ins>     <script>         (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     <\/script> <\/div>  <p><strong>2. Change your activity<\/strong><\/p>  <ul> <li>Whenever overthinking thoughts is running in your mind, then to avoid this make a change in the current activity which you are doing.<\/li> <li>If you are going through an issue related to a <a href='\/articles\/relationship.html'>relationship<\/a>, then think and do something related to your hobbies or the activity which you like to do.<\/li> <li>Similarly, plan some changes in your day to day activity, which will make some change in your routine and this will help people to avoid such overthinking in future.<\/li> <li>It&#39;s more like Training your brain to do change activities when you are overthinking something. This is a gradual process which can take some time to work it out.<\/li> <\/ul>  <p><strong>3. Constantly look out for problems<\/strong><\/p>  <ul> <li>Constantly looking out for the problems, means you can or you will be ready with your strategy to deal with the problem.<\/li> <li>Importantly you need to know, this is one of the cases where it can lead to overthinking. You need to overcome this, I mean it is good to constantly look out for problems and have a strategy to deal with problems, at the same time you have to make sure you are not overthinking on the problem, which might lead you to get stuck there.<\/li> <li>For example related to your <a href='\/articles\/health.html'>health<\/a>, it is good to understand your body and health and to what you are vulnerable, so that you can be prepared to deal with it. At the same time it doesn&rsquo;t mean you need to visit a doctor or do a health checkup unwantedly, because you are worried about your health.<\/li> <\/ul>  <div class='google-ad'>     <ins class='adsbygoogle'          style='display:block; text-align:center;'          data-ad-layout='in-article'          data-ad-format='fluid'          data-ad-client='ca-pub-2683569506254139'          data-ad-slot='5228875751'><\/ins>     <script>         (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     <\/script> <\/div>  <p><strong>4. Focus on problem solving<\/strong><\/p>  <ul> <li>It&rsquo;s very important for your mind to focus on problem solving, and yes your strategies should help you to do this.<\/li> <li>And also you need to consider, not all problems can be solved by yourself, which means there are some issues that are out of your control, like a natural disaster etc.<\/li> <li>You need to focus on the stuff which you can sort it out, and for the issues which are not in your hand, you need to be prepared to cope up with the situation.<\/li> <\/ul>  <p>I see with the above points you might get a picture of how to avoid overthinking during a situation and you should have understood, thinking is okay to come up with strategy but not to keep thinking and be stuck there.<\/p>  <p>A good example from Mahabharatha, while Arjuna was in the battle field and saw his Teachers, Relatives and Friends on the opposite side, he was too overthinking and got to a conclusion to not do the battle. Here Krishna was there to guide Arjuna and help him to overcome the overthinking and helped Arjuna to do the battle, because it&#39;s a need to do battle to keep Dharma in line.<\/p>  <p>To conclude, at some point of life every one will fall into this loop of overthinking, there might be people around you to help you out or there might be no one to help you out. In either case, you should be prepared and your mind should be brilliant enough to have the strategy and deal with the problem.<\/p>  <p>Thanks for reading the article, for more such interesting articles <a href='\/articles\/lifestyle.html'>read out Lifestyle section<\/a> at <a href='\/articles\/index.html'>PeoplesBLOG<\/a>.<\/p>","type":"Lifestyle","category":"Life,Relationship,Health","banner600x500":"upload\/banners\/stop-overthinking-your-thoughts-of-future.jpg","banner788x443":"upload\/banners\/stop-overthinking-your-thoughts-of-future.jpg","file":"2022-07-24-15-stop-overthinking-your-thoughts-of-future.json"},{"title":"Monkeypox Outbreak around the World in 2022","created":"25 Jul, 2022","updated":"2022-12-01T08:00:00+05:30","author":"Karthik Kumar D K","views":"463","summary":"The outbreak of monkeypox, which is a viral disease, was confirmed in May 2022, once few cases were found in the United Kingdom.

When selecting a hosting platform for your Drupal website, there are several key factors to consider.<\/p>  <p>Here are some important things to know before making a decision:<\/p>  <ol> <li><strong>Compatibility with Drupal<\/strong>: Ensure that the hosting platform is compatible with Drupal&#39;s technical requirements. Drupal has specific requirements for PHP version, database support (such as MySQL or PostgreSQL), and server configurations. Verify that the hosting platform meets these requirements to ensure optimal performance and compatibility.<\/li> <li><strong>Performance and Scalability<\/strong>: Look for a hosting platform that offers reliable performance and scalability. Check if they utilize caching mechanisms, content delivery networks (CDNs), and other performance optimization techniques. Scalability is crucial to accommodate traffic spikes and future growth, so consider if the hosting platform offers options to easily scale resources as needed.<\/li>      <div class='google-ad'>         <ins class='adsbygoogle'              style='display:block; text-align:center;'              data-ad-layout='in-article'              data-ad-format='fluid'              data-ad-client='ca-pub-2683569506254139'              data-ad-slot='4812668708'><\/ins>         <script>             (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});         <\/script>     <\/div>          <li><strong>Security Features<\/strong>: Website security is vital to protect your Drupal installation and user data. Ensure that the hosting platform provides robust security measures such as firewalls, malware scanning, DDoS protection, SSL certificates, and regular backups. Additionally, check if they offer timely security updates and patching to keep your website secure.<\/li> <li><strong>Support and Expertise<\/strong>: Consider the level of support and expertise provided by the hosting platform. Determine if they have experience in hosting Drupal websites and if their support team is knowledgeable about Drupal-specific issues. Reliable customer support can be invaluable in case of technical difficulties or questions related to your hosting environment.<\/li>      <div class='google-ad'>         <ins class='adsbygoogle'              style='display:block; text-align:center;'              data-ad-layout='in-article'              data-ad-format='fluid'              data-ad-client='ca-pub-2683569506254139'              data-ad-slot='5228875751'><\/ins>         <script>             (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});         <\/script>     <\/div>          <li><strong>Uptime and Reliability<\/strong>: Look for a hosting platform that guarantees high uptime and reliability. Downtime can adversely affect user experience and website performance. Check if the hosting provider has redundant infrastructure, backup power systems, and monitoring capabilities to ensure maximum uptime.<\/li> <li><strong>Ease of Use and Management<\/strong>: Consider the hosting platform&#39;s user interface and management tools. An intuitive control panel or dashboard can make it easier to manage your Drupal installation, domains, databases, and other aspects of your hosting environment. Some hosting platforms offer specific Drupal-focused features or integrations that simplify Drupal management tasks.<\/li>      <div class='google-ad'>         <ins class='adsbygoogle'             style='display:block; text-align:center;'             data-ad-layout='in-article'             data-ad-format='fluid'             data-ad-client='ca-pub-2683569506254139'             data-ad-slot='9621211280'><\/ins>         <script>             (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});         <\/script>     <\/div>          <li><strong>Pricing and Scalability<\/strong>: Evaluate the pricing plans offered by the hosting platform. Consider the cost relative to the features and resources provided. Assess if they offer flexible plans or upgrade options to accommodate your website&#39;s growth. Be cautious of overly cheap hosting options that may compromise performance, security, or support.<\/li> <li><strong>User Reviews and Reputation<\/strong>: Research the hosting platform&#39;s reputation and read user reviews to gauge the experiences of other Drupal users.

White rice, on the other hand, is stripped of these layers during processing, resulting in a loss of some nutrients.<\/li>      <div class='google-ad'>         <ins class='adsbygoogle'              style='display:block; text-align:center;'              data-ad-layout='in-article'              data-ad-format='fluid'              data-ad-client='ca-pub-2683569506254139'              data-ad-slot='4812668708'><\/ins>         <script>             (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});         <\/script>     <\/div>          <li><strong>Fiber Content<\/strong>: Brown rice is a good source of dietary fiber due to the presence of bran. Fiber aids in digestion, promotes satiety, and helps regulate blood sugar levels. White rice, having undergone processing, contains much less fiber.<\/li> <li><strong>Glycemic Index<\/strong>: The glycemic index (GI) measures the effect of carbohydrates on blood sugar levels. Brown rice has a lower GI compared to white rice, meaning it has a slower and steadier impact on blood sugar.

Some people prefer the taste and texture of brown rice, while others prefer the familiarity of white rice.<\/li> <li><strong>Cooking Time<\/strong>: Brown rice generally takes longer to cook than white rice.
