This example will use the <code>DrupalWebTestCase::drupalGet()<\/code> method in order to tell the internal browser to navigate to the URL <code>\/helloworld<\/code>.

Those adjustments allow birds to cut through the sky more nimbly than rigid drones. Now, using new insights into exactly how pigeons joints control the spread of their wing feathers, researchers have built a robotic pigeon, dubbed <strong>PigeonBot<\/strong>, whose feathered wings change shape like the real deal<\/p>  <p>This research paves the way for creating more agile aircraft, says <strong>Dario Floreano, a roboticist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne in Switzerland<\/strong> not involved in the work.<\/p>  <p>With birdlike wings, airborne machines could make tighter turns in cluttered spaces, such as around buildings or in forests, and could better navigate rough air, Floreano says (SN: 1\/24\/15). The new robot, described January 16 in Science Robotics, also offers a way to study the nuts and bolts of bird flight without animal experiments.<\/p>  <div class='google-ad' id='google-ad-1'> <p>Google Ad 1<\/p> <\/div>  <p>Researchers bent and extended the wings of dead pigeons to investigate how the birds control their wing shape. Those experiments revealed that the angles of two wing joints, the wrist and the finger, most affect the alignment of a wings flight feathers. The orientations of those long, stiff feathers, which support the bird in flight, help determine the wings shape. Based on those findings, the team built a robot with real pigeon <a href='\/quick-read\/the-cat-and-the-parrot.html'>feathers<\/a>, whose faux wrists and fingers can morph its wing shape as seen in the pigeon cadavers.<\/p>  <p>Besides laying the groundwork for building more graceful drones, whats really cool about this robot is you can make manipulations in a robot wing that you could never do or want to do in a bird to study flight, says <strong>David Lentink, an engineer and biologist at Stanford University.<\/strong><\/p>  <p>For instance, Lentink wondered whether a pigeon could steer itself just by bending the finger joint of either its left or right wing. The problem is, of course, I dont really know how to train a bird to just move its finger and I actually am very good in bird training, he says by phone, as two pet birds chirp in the background.<\/p>  <p>A controllable robotic pigeon solves that problem. In flight tests, Lentinks team observed that bending only the finger of one wing eased the robot into a banked turn offering the first evidence that birds may sometimes use just their fingers to steer in flight.<\/p>  <p>In a second study, reported in the Jan. 17 Science, Lentinks group used their robotic wing design to confirm another insight into bird flight: how gaps are prevented from forming between feathers on extended wings. In experiments that involved rubbing one bird feather across the top of another to mimic overlapping flight feathers fanning out researchers found that two feathers initially slid apart easily, but then snagged on each other. Scanning electron and X-ray microscopy images revealed that tiny hooks protruding from the top of one feather latch onto ridges on the underside of the other when they slide too far apart. Those microscopic hooks unfasten when the <a href='\/quick-read\/the-hunter-and-the-magical-bird.html'>feathers<\/a> slot back together.<\/p>  <div class='google-ad' id='google-ad-2'> <p>Google Ad 2<\/p> <\/div>  <p><strong>Thats the secret. They have this directional Velcro that holds feathers together<\/strong>, Lentink says.<\/p>  <p>To confirm the effect of these microstructures, the researchers rotated the feathers on their robot so that they wouldnt slide against each other when wings were extended. In wind tunnel and outdoor flight tests, gaps formed between <a href='\/quick-read\/a-wise-old-owl.html'>feathers<\/a> on the modified robot wings, undermining the wings stability.<\/p>  <p>This is the best set of robotic wings yet for testing how birds coordinate their flight feathers to maneuver through the air, says Tyson Hedrick, a biomechanist the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill not involved in the work. But theres plenty of room for improvement. For instance, a future flying robot could include a shoulder joint, to investigate how tilting a birds wings up and down influences flight, he says.<\/p>  <p>Thanks for reading the article,&nbsp;<a href='\/articles\/sci-tech.html'>for more Science &amp; Technology related articles<\/a>&nbsp;<a href='\/articles\/index.html'>read and subscribe to peoples blog articles<\/a>.<\/p> ","type":"Social Media","category":"Sci-Tech","banner788x443":"\/upload\/banners\/pigeon-bot_feat.jpg","file":"2020-05-31-PigeonBot-is-the-first-robot-that-can-bend-its-wings.json"},{"title":"Scientists Have Created Hexagonal Salt, For First Time Ever","created":"01 Jun, 2020","updated":"2022-12-01T08:00:00+05:30","author":"Karthik Kumar D K","views":"463","summary":"While it probably won't make it to your dining table, a new scientific achievement might be able to help in everything from radar equipment to electric cars: scientists have been able to form salt, aka sodium chloride (NaCl), in a hexagonal shape","content":"<p>While it probably won't make it to your dining table, a new scientific achievement might be able to help in everything from radar equipment to electric cars: <strong>scientists have been able to form salt, aka sodium chloride (NaCl), in a hexagonal shape<\/strong><\/p><p>This is work done at the smallest of scales, with researchers able to get a thin film of hexagonal salt to form on top of a layer of diamond, due to the chemical interaction of both film and diamond substrate - something the team actually predicted would happen in advance through simulations.<\/p><p>It's the latest in a series of discoveries where scientists have been <strong>able to synthesise 2D materials with unusual crystal structures<\/strong>, and it's partly this self-imposed restriction to two dimensions that is enabling new and exotic structures to be formed.<\/p><p>\"Initially we decided to perform only a computational study of the formation of new 2D structures on different substrates, driven by the hypothesis that if a substrate interacts strongly with the NaCl thin film, one can expect major changes in the structure of the thin film,\" says material scientist Kseniya Tikhomirova from the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech) in Russia.<\/p><p>\"<strong>Indeed, we obtained very interesting results and predicted the formation of a hexagonal NaCl film on the diamond substrate<\/strong>, and decided to perform experiments.

Few are too closed or hardly share anything personal.. Few of them share, if they feel other person is safe to share..<\/p>                                <p>Safe ones are these people, <strong>who will listen and not be judgemental or not shamed to listen<\/strong>. When someone listens like that, person will feel accepted for who they are. In a relationship both can experience different levels of closeness.<\/p>                                                                <p>If you are with someone who is close and is ready to listen and understand what you are sharing which is secret or private for you, then you are the happiest couple.<\/p>                                <p>If you are with someone who is not that close, if you feel so then its your responsibility to sort it like set the boundaries, which can be improved in further time. <strong>End of the day you are dealing with your life partner<\/strong>.<\/p>                                <h3>Upto what extent I can share?<\/h3>                                <p>Hahaa.. Its difficult, if you are not sure what level of openness is fine or not. This actually depends upon your past experiences, and the person whom you communicate too.<\/p>                                <p>You generally share your most intimate stuff with your romatic partners, <strong>you will tend to create or already have a special bond<\/strong>, thats unique and only one to say. This is the one which creates strong attachment, a sense of trust & a sense of that partner belongs to you.<\/p>                                                                <h3>What if I hold back?<\/h3>                                <p>Here is the relationship starts suffering, when we are holding back. Yes we have right, to have privacy and secrets to ourself, but this is the point where we start loosing the trust, Emotionally we might not be able to show up, It might lead to decrease in the intimacy levels with partner. Its nearly impossible to feel connected.<\/p>                                <h3>Why do you want to hold back?<\/h3>                                <p>Their could be many reasons, may be you have shared something in the past and did not felt safe. This is not something you have to be worried or feared about, You have to move towards more trusting ways so that you can open up to experience the emotional feel of connection.<\/p>                                <h3>Why will I keep it private?<\/h3>                                <p>Keeping private is very individuals choice, It is really not required to share every thought, feeling or an experience. Healthy Adult relationship between couple will be more like have each others space and respect each others privacy.<\/p>                                                                <h3>What is the difference? Secret & Privacy<\/h3>                                <p>Having privacy in a relationship might not affect on your relationship, but a secret will surely make any one you hurt.<\/p>                                <p><strong>Lets deal with a example<\/strong>, If you do not like your partners hairstyle or eating\/sleeping habits or friends.

You loose trust, intimacy & emotion between partners.<\/p>                                <p>Finally, what i want to say is.. <strong>we have to learn to give ourself..<\/strong> In a healthy relationship, we will find the words to convey what we want to share, so that it will be received as a welcomed gift by other.<\/p>","type":"Lifestyle","category":"Couple","banner394x449":"\/upload\/banner394x449\/public\/Peoples-Blog-Openness-in-couples-relationship_0.jpg","banner600x500":"\/upload\/banner600x500\/public\/Peoples-Blog-Openness-in-couples-relationship_0.jpg","banner788x443":"\/upload\/banners\/Peoples-Blog-Openness-in-couples-relationship_0.jpg","banner800x460":"\/upload\/banner800x460\/public\/Peoples-Blog-Openness-in-couples-relationship_0.jpg","file":"2020-06-14-Openness-in-Relationships-Secret-or-Private.json"},{"title":"Construction materials for Thermal Resistance Walls, Earth Bricks","created":"20 Jun, 2020","updated":"2022-12-01T08:00:00+05:30","author":"Karthik Kumar D K","views":"463","summary":"Construction process can be tedious, time consuming, and expensive.

In the story plot he would have got this music cd along with the books which he requested for. And all people in the prison for a while senses their soul of freedom. And he get punished by warden for the same.<\/p>                                <p>But, If we understand why he did this? Andy is saying, hope can't be taken away from him by the prison which is exactly what music represents.

They were talking, Andy might end up like Brooks. But as a twist in the movie, Andy escapes prison by digging wall, which Red had taught it would 600 years to dig with small hammer.<\/p>                                <p>If we take a look at this sentence once again. Red was regaining hope for life. But Andy didn't lost hope and he for preparing for freedom. And Red regains hope, we can see it while Red go up for third time parole and get's out of Prison. He can't leave the country though.<\/p>                                <h4><sup><i class=\"fa fa-quote-left\"><\/i><\/sup> They send you here for life, and that's exactly what they take. <sup><i class=\"fa fa-quote-right\"><\/i><\/sup><\/h4>                                <p>Andy says this to Red, while he has a first proper communication after few days in prison. At the end of the movie, if we re-call we understand that Andy didn't loose hope and he started to play Red for his Freedom at this time itself.<\/p>                                <h4><sup><i class=\"fa fa-quote-left\"><\/i><\/sup> The world went and got itself in a big damn hurry. <sup><i class=\"fa fa-quote-right\"><\/i><\/sup><\/h4>                                <p>World would look very different for a person like Brooks, who spent roughly 50 years in the prison. Who hangs himself later, who has lost the hope, he never got freedom as well.<\/p>                                <p>Brooks would be writing letters to his friends who are still at prison.

We could use a module called Hacked and check if any modules are hacked or not.<\/p>                                <h4>Content, Users & Configuration migration<\/h4>                                <p>To migrate content, users and configuration we can use the drupal 8\/9 core itself. It would be very straight forward like, list out the content types, fields added to content type or users and Create the same ones in drupal 8\/9. Later create content & users manually or with an automated approach. Similarly for configuration you can anaylyse and create.<\/p>                                <h4>Equivalent D8\/9 Contrib Module\/Theme\/Library<\/h4>                                <p>Finding equivalent D8\/9 Contrib Module\/Theme\/Library is pretty tricky one. The reason is you have to see what existing D7 module was providing is same or less or more than the new D8\/9 module. You might have to do small POC & get it confirmed before you proceed with these new modules.<\/p>                                <h4>Custom Code migration, either Custom Module\/Theme\/Library<\/h4>                                <p>Custom code migration is a crutial part. You need to detail analysis of exisiting code, like in and out of the code and come up with the solution diagram kid of stuff.. which would help other team members. And you should be ready with segregating code like which piece to go where or sub modules or any independent libraries or any common code.<\/p>                                <h4>Check, was their any code dependent on third party applications<\/h4>                                <p>Also it pretty important to check if any code is dependent on third party applications, like API is returing the data to be used on the drupal application or any such similar case.<\/p>                                <p>This is a brief of Audit to start with on Drupal 7 to Drupal 8\/9, I'll be writing in detail of each in further articles.

In some cases the assumptions made might not be having an actual solution while implementing it. Or in some cases assumptions would be made only for the best cases.<\/p>                            <p>Experts came up with a term called Planning Fallacy, which is a bias that humans have of being overly optimistic.<\/p>                            <p>They suggest that planning fallacy would happen as a result of a habit of assuming the best case scenario and ignoring the historical data.

Effort estimation<\/h4>                            <p>Effort estimation pretty much includes everything from time, capacity, skill needed & resources available. We need to get the effort needed for a project to get a high-level picture at the early stages of the project.<\/p>                            <h4>2. Cost estimation<\/h4>                            <p>Cost estimation is also important to run the project efficiently, and you can ensure the client or stakeholder that you have needed a budget to complete the project. And it's important to get this data at an early stage of the project lifecycle.<\/p>                            <div class=\"google-ad\">                                <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\"                                     style=\"display:block; text-align:center;\"                                     data-ad-layout=\"in-article\"                                     data-ad-format=\"fluid\"                                     data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2683569506254139\"                                     data-ad-slot=\"4812668708\"><\/ins>                                <script>                                    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});                                <\/script>                            <\/div>                            <h4>3. Resource estimation<\/h4>                            <p>You have to plan for all the resources including people, tools, softwares, hardwares, any licences etc. You have to make sure when & how much resources are needed at a single point of time.<\/p>                            <h4>4. Time estimation<\/h4>                            <p>You should get a defined schedule, which has a buffer time with all the milestones estimated. Ideally preparing a Project schedule will get you a better picture. And by this you will be able to indicate clients or stakeholders when they can see results.<\/p>                            <h3>Why do estimates go long?<\/h3>                            <p>Generally estimating a project itself will take nearly 30% of the project's entire time span. And yes this long time is needed, to get a better & proper plan, which includes creating all planning doc\u2019s & a proper project management plan.<\/p>                            <h3>And few approaches for estimating!<\/h3>                            <p>There are few approaches used by project managers for project estimation and they make sure to keep this process very agile so that it's easy to manage. Below are the few approaches.<\/p>                            <ul class=\"check\">                                <li>Top-Down approach<\/li>                                <li>Bottom-Up approach<\/li>                                <li>Analogous approach<\/li>                                <li>Parametric approach<\/li>                                <li>Three-point approach<\/li>                                <li>What-If analysis<\/li>                            <\/ul>                            <p>Will detail it out about the above mentioned approaches in the future article.<\/p>                            <p>So, project estimation is really necessary for project planning.

Syntax in template engine<\/h4>                            <p>Drupal 8 will be accessing all the variables very consistently like <code>{{ node.nid }}<\/code> or <code>{{ node_url }}<\/code>, wherein Drupal 7 we have multiple ways to print a particular variable, including strings, objects & arrays.<\/p>                            <div class=\"google-ad\">                                <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\"                                     style=\"display:block; text-align:center;\"                                     data-ad-layout=\"in-article\"                                     data-ad-format=\"fluid\"                                     data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2683569506254139\"                                     data-ad-slot=\"4812668708\"><\/ins>                                <script>                                    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});                                <\/script>                            <\/div>                            <h4>2. Inconsistency in PHP templates<\/h4>                            <p>In Drupal 7 we can use template files and at the same time, we can use the functions to render. Sometimes it becomes harder to understand already written code or the Core code (without documentation) & also we see difficulties in overriding the code. But Drupal 8 only uses template files.<\/p>                            <h4>3. Redundancy while writing code<\/h4>                            <p>In Drupal 8 we can use the existing template, like using extends, which is a kind of proper inheritance and by this, we can eliminate the duplicate code. But in Drupal 7 we have multiple files with similar code.<\/p>                            <h4>4. Sanitize data<\/h4>                            <p>Using template engines like Twig, we can automatically sanitize the data which is to be rendered. So there would be no way to have any unsafe functions like in Drupal earlier version like in Drupal 7 we can print the unsanitized data to render & even we would be able to do database queries. Here Twig is responsible for sanitizing data.<\/p>                            <h4>5. Caching<\/h4>                            <p>And also handling of caches are improved in Drupal when compared to earlier versions (which is discussed in this article), which will keep any template engine at top of its performance.<\/p>                            <p>Overall, Drupal as a framework now has moved to a more efficient and optimized way of rendering a site\u2019s theme through the use of Twig.<\/p>","type":"Drupal","category":"Twig,Php,Web,Sci-Tech","banner600x500":"\/upload\/banner600x500\/public\/drupal-twig.png","banner788x443":"\/upload\/banners\/drupal-twig.png","file":"2021-08-14-16-Understand-why-Twig-is-replacing-PHP-Template-in-Drupal.json"},{"title":"Know why Symfony framework was picked by Drupal","created":"22 Aug, 2021","updated":"2022-12-01T08:00:00+05:30","author":"Karthik Kumar D K","views":"463","summary":"Drupal made a step forward by building Drupal core using Symfony components, to meet the developers expectations.

While Drupal 8 was out and it had a buzz of being <strong>responsive<\/strong>, <strong>mobile friendly<\/strong>. And yes, the Internet is on the verge of being dominated by smartphones & Drupal needs to be prepared.<\/p><p>Mobile friendly will also mean <strong>the content is first<\/strong>. From a big screen to a little screen, elements would look different, Images would be responsive, menu items would render as drop-downs, columns are moved to top\/bottom based on flexibility of view on different screens.<\/p><p>If <strong>Drupal is providing mobile friendly means<\/strong>, one should be able to use it as 100% responsive with at least the core drupal code. Let\u2019s take a closer look at what Drupal is providing to say itself as Responsive web design.<\/p><h3>Just Drupal Core<\/h3><p>With fresh Drupal you get <strong>Bartik<\/strong> as front end theme & Seven as the admin theme where both the themes are really responsive. In one word if you wanna say, one can manage content from the mobile device with <strong>Seven<\/strong> theme. As long as you are just adding content then you are good to go with Seven & Bartik.<\/p><h3>Modules in Drupal Core<\/h3><p>We have two modules in the Drupal core, <strong>Breakpoint<\/strong> and <strong>Responsive Image<\/strong> which are making the site responsive. On fresh drupal installation you can see the Breakpoint module already enabled which will help the admin toolbar to be responsive.<\/p><p>Breakpoint module will provide the ability to make the site <strong>change at different screen sizes<\/strong>. This module will provide a <strong>way to identify and use the breakpoints<\/strong>, based on this the front end developers and site builders can make the site look more responsive.<\/p><div class=\"google-ad\">                                <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\"                                     style=\"display:block; text-align:center;\"                                     data-ad-layout=\"in-article\"                                     data-ad-format=\"fluid\"                                     data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2683569506254139\"                                     data-ad-slot=\"4812668708\"><\/ins>                                <script>                                    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});                                <\/script>                            <\/div><p>Even though we have a way to define breakpoints for our theme, we still need to do something for images to look responsive. And for this Responsive Image module can be enabled.<\/p><p>Responsive Image module requires Breakpoint module to be enabled, because it uses the breakpoints that are defined in the theme along with image styles.<\/p><p>In the older version of Drupal, there was a module called Picture, which was helping to create responsive images. Now this module is the same as a Responsive image module. And there is still configuration that must be set up for the Responsive image module, but unlike Breakpoint there is a user interface to do your configuration. <\/p><p>These are responsive design benifits would be available from the Drupal Core. Thanks to that, Drupal CMS is more responsive and provides better efficiency for Content teams.<\/p>","type":"Drupal","category":"Php,Web,Sci-Tech","banner600x500":"\/upload\/banners\/responsive-web-design.jpg","banner788x443":"\/upload\/banners\/responsive-web-design.jpg","file":"2021-10-07-16-What-Drupal-offers-as-Responsive-Web-Design-within-Core.json"},{"title":"Bangalore to Makalidurga - Trekking","created":"30 Oct, 2021","updated":"2022-12-01T08:00:00+05:30","author":"Karthik Kumar D K","views":"463","summary":"Makalidurga is a hill fort situated 60 km north of Bangalore.

And it&#39;s done by modifying some lines of code within your <code>services.yml<\/code> file which will be located at <code>sites\/default\/services.yml<\/code>, as shown below.<\/p>  <p><code>parameters:<br \/> &nbsp;&nbsp;twig.config:<br \/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;debug: true<\/code><\/p>  <p>By default, you can see the value set to <code>false<\/code>, you need to set it to <code>true<\/code>.<\/p>  <p>Once you do this and rebuild the caches, you can see the existing template suggestion on inspecting the web page locally.<\/p>  <p>Now you have to write the code to alter the template suggestions, which will give you more control to create the twig template files.<\/p>  <p>And Drupal provides hooks to do this, and hook_theme_suggestions_HOOK_alter is the hook which does the purpose.<\/p>  <p>Let&rsquo;s take an example to alter the template suggestions of the taxonomy term page, and with the below code you can do it.<\/p>  <div class='google-ad'>     <ins class='adsbygoogle'          style='display:block; text-align:center;'          data-ad-layout='in-article'          data-ad-format='fluid'          data-ad-client='ca-pub-2683569506254139'          data-ad-slot='4812668708'><\/ins>     <script>         (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     <\/script> <\/div>  <p><code>use Drupal\\taxonomy\\TermInterface;<br \/> \/**<br \/> &nbsp;* Implements hook_theme_suggestions_HOOK_alter().<br \/> &nbsp;*\/<br \/> function mytheme_theme_suggestions_taxonomy_term_alter(&amp;$suggestions, $variables) {<br \/> &nbsp;&nbsp;$elements = $variables[&#39;elements&#39;];<br \/> &nbsp;&nbsp;if (isset($elements[&#39;#taxonomy_term&#39;]) &amp;&amp; isset($elements[&#39;#theme&#39;]) &amp;&amp; isset($elements[&#39;#view_mode&#39;])) {<br \/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$term = $elements[&#39;#taxonomy_term&#39;];<br \/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if ($term instanceof TermInterface) {<br \/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$suggestions[] = $elements[&#39;#theme&#39;] . &#39;__&#39; . $term-&gt;bundle() . &#39;__&#39; . $elements[&#39;#view_mode&#39;];<br \/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$suggestions[] = $elements[&#39;#theme&#39;] . &#39;__&#39; . $term-&gt;id() . &#39;__&#39; . $elements[&#39;#view_mode&#39;];<br \/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br \/> &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br \/> }<\/code><\/p>  <p>Once you write this code in your <code>.theme<\/code> file, and rebuild the caches.

What this means is,<\/p>  <ol> <li>For example, people should make sure to use the form modes and view modes of the content type, and importantly only the needed data should be passed to the form modes or view modes.<\/li> <li>Also, if you want to render just the Image URL, make sure the field from the view mode is returning just the Image URL.<\/li> <li>Don&#39;t preprocess the data, it would be a very rare case where you need to use preprocess hooks in your .theme file.<\/li> <li>If you are using a data preprocessor, it means your application is not well planned, which means you are good to make some corrections in the application.<\/li> <li>And one must make sure not to load any data from the database on the .theme file or twig file, because you are already on the rendering layer.<\/li> <\/ol>  <p>To conclude, the approach or inputs provided in the article will help drupal people to understand how they can work with twig templates.<\/p>","type":"Drupal","category":"Twig,Php,Sci-Tech","banner600x500":"\/upload\/banners\/how-to-work-with-twig-templates-in-drupal.png","banner788x443":"\/upload\/banners\/how-to-work-with-twig-templates-in-drupal.png","file":"2022-06-24-19-how-to-work-with-twig-templates-in-drupal.json"},{"title":"Dal Bhat Recipe - Nepali Style","created":"29 Jun, 2022","updated":"2022-12-01T08:00:00+05:30","author":"Reddamma D","views":"463","summary":"Dal Bhat or Nepali Dal Bhat, is a dish made of lentils and rice, actually It is considered that this is the national dish of Nepal.

If you are an overthinker or a person who thinks to take precautions for the future, then you will know exactly how it goes. Generally a problem comes to your mind, for example a worry or health or a problem at work or some sort of issue in a relationship, because of the thoughts you will be thinking about it a lot and you will try to get a solution for this as soon as possible and you will be overthinking it.<\/p>  <p>Actually, when we spend too much time thinking of thoughts, we mostly end up with the same situation of where we started.<\/p>  <p>And sometimes, people&rsquo;s overthinking can result in trouble concentrating on other stuff and this can become a cycle of overthinking and may lead to serious concerns.<\/p>  <p>After reading a few articles and watching a few videos, I have found a few common strategies to calm down and come out of overthinking and to stop overthinking.<\/p>  <ol> <li>Plan too much<\/li> <li>Change your activity<\/li> <li>Constantly look out for problems<\/li> <li>Focus on problem solving<\/li> <\/ol>  <p><strong>1. Plan too much<\/strong><\/p>  <ul> <li>Plan too much means, plan really too many possible ways for a problem which you think, it exists or it might come in the future.<\/li> <li>If you are having too many plans like Plan A, Plan B going on Plan Z or more, then you will have a solution for your problem.<\/li> <li>Good advantage of having many plans is, our mind will be busy preparing plans and will not get stuck on thinking about problems.<\/li> <li>In many cases, the other Plans might be helpful in sorting out some other problem in your future.<\/li> <li>For example you have many plans for your financial stability for your future like Savings, Inherited income, Active earnings and Passive earnings. Means these are the different plans which you have. In case you are not having Active incomes and Out of Savings, then your Inherited income and Passive earnings will keep you out of the problem.<\/li> <\/ul>  <div class='google-ad'>     <ins class='adsbygoogle'          style='display:block; text-align:center;'          data-ad-layout='in-article'          data-ad-format='fluid'          data-ad-client='ca-pub-2683569506254139'          data-ad-slot='4812668708'><\/ins>     <script>         (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     <\/script> <\/div>  <p><strong>2. Change your activity<\/strong><\/p>  <ul> <li>Whenever overthinking thoughts is running in your mind, then to avoid this make a change in the current activity which you are doing.<\/li> <li>If you are going through an issue related to a <a href='\/articles\/relationship.html'>relationship<\/a>, then think and do something related to your hobbies or the activity which you like to do.<\/li> <li>Similarly, plan some changes in your day to day activity, which will make some change in your routine and this will help people to avoid such overthinking in future.<\/li> <li>It&#39;s more like Training your brain to do change activities when you are overthinking something. This is a gradual process which can take some time to work it out.<\/li> <\/ul>  <p><strong>3. Constantly look out for problems<\/strong><\/p>  <ul> <li>Constantly looking out for the problems, means you can or you will be ready with your strategy to deal with the problem.<\/li> <li>Importantly you need to know, this is one of the cases where it can lead to overthinking. You need to overcome this, I mean it is good to constantly look out for problems and have a strategy to deal with problems, at the same time you have to make sure you are not overthinking on the problem, which might lead you to get stuck there.<\/li> <li>For example related to your <a href='\/articles\/health.html'>health<\/a>, it is good to understand your body and health and to what you are vulnerable, so that you can be prepared to deal with it. At the same time it doesn&rsquo;t mean you need to visit a doctor or do a health checkup unwantedly, because you are worried about your health.<\/li> <\/ul>  <div class='google-ad'>     <ins class='adsbygoogle'          style='display:block; text-align:center;'          data-ad-layout='in-article'          data-ad-format='fluid'          data-ad-client='ca-pub-2683569506254139'          data-ad-slot='5228875751'><\/ins>     <script>         (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});     <\/script> <\/div>  <p><strong>4. Focus on problem solving<\/strong><\/p>  <ul> <li>It&rsquo;s very important for your mind to focus on problem solving, and yes your strategies should help you to do this.<\/li> <li>And also you need to consider, not all problems can be solved by yourself, which means there are some issues that are out of your control, like a natural disaster etc.<\/li> <li>You need to focus on the stuff which you can sort it out, and for the issues which are not in your hand, you need to be prepared to cope up with the situation.<\/li> <\/ul>  <p>I see with the above points you might get a picture of how to avoid overthinking during a situation and you should have understood, thinking is okay to come up with strategy but not to keep thinking and be stuck there.<\/p>  <p>A good example from Mahabharatha, while Arjuna was in the battle field and saw his Teachers, Relatives and Friends on the opposite side, he was too overthinking and got to a conclusion to not do the battle. Here Krishna was there to guide Arjuna and help him to overcome the overthinking and helped Arjuna to do the battle, because it&#39;s a need to do battle to keep Dharma in line.<\/p>  <p>To conclude, at some point of life every one will fall into this loop of overthinking, there might be people around you to help you out or there might be no one to help you out. In either case, you should be prepared and your mind should be brilliant enough to have the strategy and deal with the problem.<\/p>  <p>Thanks for reading the article, for more such interesting articles <a href='\/articles\/lifestyle.html'>read out Lifestyle section<\/a> at <a href='\/articles\/index.html'>PeoplesBLOG<\/a>.<\/p>","type":"Lifestyle","category":"Life,Relationship,Health","banner600x500":"\/upload\/banners\/stop-overthinking-your-thoughts-of-future.jpg","banner788x443":"\/upload\/banners\/stop-overthinking-your-thoughts-of-future.jpg","file":"2022-07-24-15-stop-overthinking-your-thoughts-of-future.json"},{"title":"Monkeypox Outbreak around the World in 2022","created":"25 Jul, 2022","updated":"2022-12-01T08:00:00+05:30","author":"Karthik Kumar D K","views":"463","summary":"The outbreak of monkeypox, which is a viral disease, was confirmed in May 2022, once few cases were found in the United Kingdom.

And water it well.<\/p>  <p>5 to 7 hours of sunlight is needed every day. Every 15 days dig up the top layer of the soil to keep fluffy, so that bulbs grow big in size. Water only when soil is dry, avoid wet conditions.<\/p>  <p>Once the leaves are turning brown and in dead state, this is the time to harvest the Garlic.

Add compost every 15 days for better growth.<\/p>  <p>Peas will often have issues with insects and disease and are generally ready to eat about three weeks after they start to flower.<\/p>  <p>Harvest as soon as they are plump and ripe, if they are left to peak, then they lose their sweetness.<\/p>  <p><strong>5.

Addressing and managing mental health issues can help improve physical health outcomes.<\/li> <li><strong>Mind-body connection<\/strong>: The mind and body are closely interconnected, and our mental state can influence physical functioning.

For instance, someone experiencing chronic stress or depression may be more likely to engage in unhealthy coping mechanisms like overeating, substance abuse, or a sedentary lifestyle. Conversely, when we prioritize our mental well-being, we tend to make healthier choices such as regular exercise, balanced nutrition, and adequate sleep.<\/li> <li><strong>Exercise and mental health<\/strong>: Regular physical activity has been shown to have significant benefits for mental health. Exercise releases endorphins, which are natural mood-boosting chemicals in the brain.

Here are some reasons why Drupal is a popular choice for non-profit websites:<\/p>  <ol> <li><strong>Cost-Effectiveness<\/strong>: Drupal is an open-source platform, which means it is free to use and distribute. This can be particularly advantageous for non-profit organizations that often have limited budgets. Choosing Drupal allows non-profits to allocate their resources towards other critical areas such as programs and initiatives.<\/li> <li><strong>Customization and Flexibility<\/strong>: Drupal offers extensive customization options, allowing non-profit organizations to create unique and tailored websites that reflect their brand and mission. Drupal&#39;s modular architecture and vast library of contributed modules enable organizations to add specific functionality and features as needed.<\/li> <li><strong>Content Management<\/strong>: Non-profit websites often require frequent updates and content publishing. Drupal provides robust content management capabilities, making it easy to create, organize, and publish content. Its flexible content modeling, taxonomy, and workflows allow non-profits to structure and present their content in a meaningful way.<\/li> <li><strong>Community and Collaboration<\/strong>: Drupal has a large and active community of developers, designers, and users. Non-profit organizations can benefit from the knowledge sharing, support, and collaboration opportunities within the Drupal community. They can leverage community-contributed modules and themes, as well as seek guidance and best practices from experienced Drupal users.<\/li>      <div class='google-ad'>         <ins class='adsbygoogle'              style='display:block; text-align:center;'              data-ad-layout='in-article'              data-ad-format='fluid'              data-ad-client='ca-pub-2683569506254139'              data-ad-slot='4812668708'><\/ins>         <script>             (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});         <\/script>     <\/div>          <li><strong>Scalability<\/strong>: As non-profit organizations grow and expand their digital presence, scalability becomes crucial. Drupal is known for its scalability, allowing websites to handle increased traffic, content, and user interactions without sacrificing performance. This scalability ensures that non-profit websites can accommodate growth and effectively engage with their audience.<\/li> <li><strong>Multilingual Support<\/strong>: Non-profit organizations often work in diverse communities and may require multilingual capabilities on their websites. Drupal provides built-in support for creating multilingual websites, allowing non-profits to reach and engage with audiences in different languages.<\/li> <li><strong>Integration Capabilities<\/strong>: Non-profit organizations often rely on various software and systems for their operations, such as donor management, CRM, or email marketing tools. Drupal offers excellent integration capabilities, allowing seamless connections with these systems. This integration streamlines workflows, improves data management, and enhances the overall efficiency of non-profit operations.<\/li> <li><strong>Security and Privacy<\/strong>: Non-profit organizations handle sensitive data, such as donor information, and need to ensure the security and privacy of their users. Drupal has a strong focus on security, with a dedicated security team, regular updates, and a robust permission system. It helps non-profits maintain data security and protect the privacy of their users.<\/li>      <div class='google-ad'>         <ins class='adsbygoogle'                 style='display:block; text-align:center;'                 data-ad-layout='in-article'                 data-ad-format='fluid'                 data-ad-client='ca-pub-2683569506254139'                 data-ad-slot='5228875751'><\/ins>         <script>             (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});         <\/script>     <\/div>          <li><strong>Accessibility<\/strong>: Accessibility is a critical consideration for non-profit websites to ensure inclusivity and reach a broader audience.

Here are six harsh truths that people commonly learn from challenging experiences:<\/p>  <ol> <li><strong>Failure is a part of life<\/strong>: Bad times often teach us that failure is a natural and inevitable part of the human experience. It&#39;s through failures and setbacks that we learn, grow, and develop resilience. Embracing failure as a learning opportunity can lead to personal and professional growth.<\/li> <li><strong>Change is constant<\/strong>: Bad times can remind us that change is a fundamental aspect of life. Situations, relationships, and circumstances are subject to change, and sometimes it can be difficult to accept and adapt to those changes. Learning to be flexible and open to new possibilities can help navigate challenging times.<\/li> <li><strong>Self-reliance is crucial<\/strong>: Difficult times can highlight the importance of self-reliance and taking responsibility for our own lives. While support from others is valuable, ultimately, we must rely on ourselves to overcome challenges and build a fulfilling life. Developing self-confidence and independence can empower us to weather storms more effectively.<\/li> <li><strong>People come and go<\/strong>: Challenging times can reveal the transient nature of relationships. Some individuals may prove to be unreliable or unsupportive, while others may surprise us with their loyalty and kindness.

Bad times can serve as a reminder to make the most of the time we have.<\/li> <li><strong>Personal growth requires discomfort<\/strong>: Difficult times push us out of our comfort zones and force us to confront our weaknesses, fears, and limitations. While uncomfortable, these experiences provide opportunities for personal growth, resilience, and self-discovery. Adversity can lead to self-reflection, increased self-awareness, and the development of new strengths.<\/li> <\/ol>  <p>It&#39;s worth noting that everyone&#39;s experiences and the lessons they derive from them can vary.

Let&#39;s explore each of the four Vedas and their significance:<\/p>  <ol> <li><strong>Rigveda<\/strong>: The Rigveda is the oldest and most prominent Veda. It consists of a collection of hymns, prayers, and invocations addressed to various deities. These hymns are attributed to different sages or rishis and are dedicated to gods such as Agni (the god of fire), Indra (the god of thunder and war), and Varuna (the god of cosmic order). The Rigveda also contains philosophical and metaphysical insights, as well as descriptions of rituals and societal norms.<\/li> <li><strong>Samaveda<\/strong>: The Samaveda is derived from the Rigveda and focuses on the musical aspect of the hymns. It is a collection of melodies and chants that were sung during rituals and sacrifices. The hymns of the Samaveda are characterized by their poetic and melodic structure, and they serve as a guide for priests who perform Vedic rituals.<\/li>  <div class='google-ad'> <ins class='adsbygoogle'  style='display:block; text-align:center;'  data-ad-layout='in-article'  data-ad-format='fluid'  data-ad-client='ca-pub-2683569506254139'  data-ad-slot='4812668708'><\/ins> <script> (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); <\/script> <\/div>  <li><strong>Yajurveda<\/strong>: The Yajurveda provides instructions and guidelines for performing rituals and sacrifices. It contains prose formulas, called yajus, which are recited by the priests during ceremonies. The Yajurveda is divided into two main branches: the Krishna Yajurveda and the Shukla Yajurveda. The former focuses more on the rituals and the actions to be performed, while the latter includes both the rituals and their philosophical explanations.<\/li> <li><strong>Atharvaveda<\/strong>: The Atharvaveda is a collection of hymns, spells, and incantations. It covers a wide range of topics, including healing, protection against evil spirits, prosperity, and social and domestic life. The Atharvaveda reflects a more folkloric and practical aspect of Vedic traditions, dealing with everyday concerns and rituals related to household matters.<\/li> <\/ol>  <p>Together, the four Vedas provide a comprehensive understanding of the ancient Indian religious, philosophical, and cultural traditions. They are regarded as divine revelations and serve as the basis for Hindu rituals, spiritual practices, and moral principles. The Vedas continue to be studied, chanted, and revered by scholars, priests, and individuals seeking spiritual guidance and insight into the deep wisdom contained within these ancient texts.<\/p>  <p>The Vedas serve several purposes and hold deep significance in Hinduism and Indian culture. Here are some reasons why the Vedas are important:<\/p>  <ol> <li><strong>Religious and spiritual guidance<\/strong>: The Vedas are considered divine revelations and are regarded as the ultimate authority in Hinduism. They provide guidance on various aspects of religious and spiritual life, including rituals, prayers, moral principles, and philosophical insights. They offer a framework for understanding the nature of the divine, the cosmos, and the individual&#39;s relationship with the universe.<\/li>  <div class='google-ad'> <ins class='adsbygoogle' style='display:block; text-align:center;' data-ad-layout='in-article' data-ad-format='fluid' data-ad-client='ca-pub-2683569506254139' data-ad-slot='5228875751'><\/ins> <script> (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); <\/script> <\/div>  <li><strong>Preservation of ancient knowledge<\/strong>: The Vedas are among the oldest extant religious texts in the world. They have preserved ancient wisdom, traditions, and cultural practices that date back thousands of years. They provide a link to the rich cultural heritage and intellectual traditions of ancient India.<\/li> <li><strong>Ritual and ceremonial practices<\/strong>: The Vedas contain detailed instructions for performing rituals, sacrifices, and ceremonies. They guide priests and practitioners in carrying out various religious and ceremonial practices with precision and authenticity. The rituals described in the Vedas play a significant role in Hindu worship and are believed to have spiritual and cosmic significance.<\/li> <li><strong>Source of philosophical and metaphysical insights<\/strong>: The Vedas delve into profound philosophical and metaphysical concepts. They explore questions about the nature of reality, the purpose of life, the existence of the soul, and the interconnectedness of all beings.

In the Southern Hemisphere, panels should face true north.<\/li> <li><strong>Tilt Angle<\/strong>: The tilt angle of the panels should be approximately equal to your latitude. This helps in capturing sunlight most effectively over the course of the year.<\/li> <li><strong>Avoid Shading<\/strong>: Ensure that the panels are not shaded by trees, buildings, or other obstructions. Even partial shading can significantly reduce energy production.<\/li> <li><strong>Seasonal Adjustments (Optional)<\/strong>: If possible, consider adjustable mounts that allow you to change the tilt angle of the panels seasonally.

fluffy slime step-by-step:<\/p>  <h2>Materials:<\/h2>  <ol> <li>White school glue (PVA glue)<\/li> <li>Shaving cream (foam, not gel)<\/li> <li>Baking soda<\/li> <li>Contact lens solution (containing boric acid and sodium borate)<\/li> <li>Food coloring (optional)<\/li> <li>Mixing bowl<\/li> <li>Mixing spoon or spatula<\/li> <\/ol>  <div class='google-ad' id='google-ad-1'> <p>Google Ad 1<\/p> <\/div>  <h2>Procedure:<\/h2>  <ul> <li>Prepare the Glue Mixture: <ul> <li>Pour 1\/2 cup of white school glue into a mixing bowl.<\/li> <li>If you want to add color, mix in a few drops of food coloring at this stage. Stir until the color is evenly distributed.<\/li> <\/ul> <\/li> <li>Add Shaving Cream: <ul> <li>Add 1 cup of shaving cream to the glue mixture. The shaving cream gives the slime its fluffy texture.<\/li> <li>Stir the mixture well until it&rsquo;s fully combined and fluffy.<\/li> <\/ul> <\/li> <li>Add Baking Soda: <ul> <li>Add 1\/2 teaspoon of baking soda to the mixture. Baking soda helps firm up the slime.<\/li> <li>Mix well until the baking soda is fully incorporated.<\/li> <\/ul> <\/li> <li>Add Contact Lens Solution: <ul> <li>Add 1 tablespoon of contact lens solution to the mixture. The boric acid in the contact lens solution reacts with the glue to create the slime.<\/li> <li>Stir the mixture thoroughly. It will start to come together and become less sticky. If the slime is still too sticky, add a few more drops of contact lens solution until you reach the desired consistency.<\/li> <\/ul> <\/li> <\/ul>  <div class='google-ad' id='google-ad-2'> <p>Google Ad 2<\/p> <\/div>  <ul> <li>Knead the Slime: <ul> <li>Once the slime starts to form a ball, remove it from the bowl and knead it with your hands. Kneading helps bring the slime to the perfect consistency.<\/li> <li>If the slime is still too sticky, add a small amount of contact lens solution and continue kneading until it&#39;s stretchy and fluffy but not sticky.<\/li> <\/ul> <\/li> <li>The fluffy slime is now ready to play with! Stretch, squish, and enjoy the fluffy texture.<\/li> <\/ul>  <h2>Explanation:<\/h2>  <p>Fluffy slime is a non-Newtonian fluid, meaning it doesn&#39;t behave like a typical liquid. The glue contains polyvinyl acetate, a polymer, which creates long chains of molecules. When the contact lens solution (which contains boric acid) is added, it cross-links the polymer chains in the glue, turning it into a stretchy, fluffy substance.<\/p>  <h2>Tips:<\/h2>  <ul> <li><strong>Storage<\/strong>: Store the slime in an airtight container when not in use to keep it from drying out.<\/li> <li><strong>Experiment<\/strong>: Try making multiple batches with different amounts of shaving cream to see how it affects the texture and fluffiness.<\/li> <li><strong>Clean-Up<\/strong>: Clean up any slime spills promptly, as it can be difficult to remove once it dries.<\/li> <\/ul>  <div class='google-ad' id='google-ad-3'> <p>Google Ad 3<\/p> <\/div>  <h2>Discussion Points:<\/h2>  <ul> <li><strong>Polymers and Cross-Linking<\/strong>: Explain how the glue&#39;s polymers are linked together by the boric acid in the contact lens solution, transforming the liquid glue into a stretchy slime.<\/li> <li><strong>Non-Newtonian Fluids<\/strong>: Discuss how fluffy slime behaves differently from regular liquids and solids, making it a non-Newtonian fluid.<\/li> <li><strong>Sensory Exploration<\/strong>: Encourage children to describe the texture, stretchiness, and feel of the slime, enhancing their sensory and descriptive skills.<\/li> <\/ul>  <p>Creating fluffy slime is a fantastic way for children to explore <a href='\/articles\/elephant-toothpaste-science-experiment-for-children.html'>chemistry<\/a> concepts while having fun with a tactile and engaging activity.<\/p>  <p>Thanks for reading the article,&nbsp;<a href='\/articles\/sci-tech.html'>for more Science &amp; Technology related articles<\/a>&nbsp;<a href='\/articles\/index.html'>read and subscribe to peoples blog articles<\/a>.<\/p> ","type":"Sci-Tech","category":"Experiment,Children","banner788x443":"\/upload\/banners\/fluffy-slime-science-experiment-for-children.jpeg","file":"2024-06-17-11-fluffy-slime-science-experiment-for-children.json"},{"title":"How to prepare Kala Khatta Gola","created":"20 Jun, 2024","updated":"2024-06-20T08:57:00+05:30","author":"Karthik Kumar D K","summary":"Kala Khatta Gola, also known as Kala Khatta Ice Gola or Black Currant Ice Gola, is a popular Indian street treat, especially during the summer.","content":"<p>Kala Khatta Gola, also known as Kala Khatta Ice Gola or Black Currant Ice Gola, is a popular Indian street treat, especially during the summer.

<h3>Procedure:<\/h3>  <ol> <li>Prepare the <a href='\/articles\/magnetic-slime-science-experiment-for-children.html'>Glue Solution<\/a>:  <ul> <li>Pour 1\/2 cup of white school glue into a mixing bowl.<\/li> <li>Add 1\/2 cup of water to the glue and stir until well combined.<\/li> <li>If you want to add color to your slime, mix in a few drops of food coloring at this stage. Stir until the color is evenly distributed.<\/li> <\/ul> <\/li> <li>In a separate container, mix 1 teaspoon of Borax powder with 1 cup of warm water. Stir until the Borax is completely dissolved. This creates a Borax solution.<\/li> <li>Combine the Solutions: <ul> <li>Slowly add the Borax solution to the glue mixture, one tablespoon at a time, while stirring continuously.<\/li> <li>The slime will start to form almost immediately. Continue adding the Borax solution and stirring until the slime reaches the desired consistency. You might not need to use all of the Borax solution.<\/li> <\/ul> <\/li> <li>Knead the Slime: <ul> <li>Once the slime has formed, remove it from the bowl and knead it with your hands.

The glue contains polyvinyl acetate, a polymer that forms long chains of molecules. When the Borax solution is added, it cross-links these polymer chains, turning the liquid glue into a stretchy, gooey substance.

The idea of exploring new places, meeting diverse people, and experiencing different cultures can be incredibly thrilling.<\/li> <\/ul> <\/li> <li><strong>Preparation and Planning<\/strong>: <ul> <li>Before you embark on your journey, there&rsquo;s a lot of preparation involved. This includes saving money, researching destinations, planning your travel itinerary, and taking care of logistical details like visas, vaccinations, and insurance.<\/li> <\/ul> <\/li> <\/ul>  <h3>The Journey Begins<\/h3>  <ul> <li><strong>Freedom and Adventure<\/strong>:  <ul> <li>The sense of freedom is one of the most liberating aspects. With no daily work routine or office commitments, you can wake up in a new city, country, or continent and shape your days as you wish.<\/li> <\/ul> <\/li> <li><strong>New Experiences<\/strong>: <ul> <li>Every day brings new experiences and opportunities. You might find yourself hiking in the Himalayas one week, exploring ancient ruins in Machu Picchu the next, and relaxing on a beach in Bali after that.

Missing family, friends, and the comforts of home is a common experience.<\/li> <\/ul> <\/li> <\/ul>  <h3>Practical Considerations<\/h3>  <ul> <li><strong>Digital Nomadism<\/strong>:  <ul> <li>Many travelers fund their journeys through remote work or freelancing.

While it&rsquo;s nice to be back with loved ones, reintegrating into a regular routine and possibly re-entering the <a href='\/articles\/is-work-from-home-good-for-employees.html'>job<\/a> market can be daunting.<\/li> <\/ul> <\/li> <li><strong>Reflection and Future Plans<\/strong>: <ul> <li>Reflecting on your travels often provides clarity on your future goals and aspirations.
