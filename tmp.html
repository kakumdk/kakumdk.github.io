                                <p>It's a great thought of growing enough food to feed your family year round by yourself. Certain things are really important for such a though, like <strong>how much food is needed</strong> for your family, <strong>which crops to plant</strong>, how to <strong>get the most from your plot</strong>, and how to <strong>preserve your extra harvest.</strong></p>
                                <h3>How much food is needed?</h3>
                                <p>Let's say a 200 square feet plot will harvest the feeds for a single person all around the year. Then, 800 square feet of plot should do for 4 people family (bigger the family scale up the plot as needed).</p>
                                <p>Some crops can take up more space than others, so based on these also plot size would increase.. Let's say 1600 square feet (double) of plot would do for 4 people of family.</p>
