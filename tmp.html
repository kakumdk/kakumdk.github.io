                                <p>National Education Policy (<strong>NEP 2020</strong>) has been approved by Union Cabinet on 29 July 2020. Its major aim is to introduce changes in the <strong>Indian Education System</strong> right from the school to the college level of education. Making <strong>India a Global Knowledge Superpower</strong> is the ultimate objective of the NEP 2020. It is the <strong>third major change in education systems</strong> in India since independence in 1947. Earlier two revamps in the education systems were done in <strong>1968 and 1986</strong>.</p>
                                <p><strong>Education in India</strong> is a <strong>Concurrent List</strong> subject.</p>
                                <h4>Vision</h4>
                                <p>National Education Policy 2020 envisions, <i>An India-centric education system that contributes directly to transforming our nation sustainably into an equitable and vibrant knowledge society by providing high-quality education to all</i>.</p>
                                <h4>Few Key points from the National Education Policy 2020</h4>
                                <ul class="check">
                                    <li>The policy raises the importance of <strong>mother tongue & regional languages</strong>; medium of instruction until class 5 and preferably beyond should be in these languages. The policy also states that <strong>no language will be imposed on the students</strong>.</li>
                                    <li>The <strong>10 + 2</strong> structure will be replaced with <strong>5+3+3+4</strong> model with below Stages. Instead of having exams every academic year, school students will only attend three exams, in classes 3, 5 and 8. Board exams will be continued to be held for classes 10 & 12, but will be re-designed.</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Foundational</strong>: Preschool + Classes 1 & 2, Ages 3-8 years, Focus of studies will be in activity-based learning.</li>

                                        <li><strong>Middle</strong>: Classes 6 to 8, Ages 11-14 years, Introduce students to more abstract concepts in subjects of mathematics, sciences, social sciences, arts & humanities.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Secondary</strong>: Classes 9 to 12, Ages 14-19 years, Intended to inculcate multidisciplinary study, coupled with depth & critical thinking. Multiple options of subjects will be provided.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <li>Coding will be introduced from Class 6, And experiential learning will be adopted.</li>
                                    <li>The Policy Proposes a 4-year multi-disciplinary bachelor's degree in an <strong>undergraduate programme with multiple exit options</strong>. These will include professional and vocational areas and will be implemented as follows</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>A certificate after completing 1 year of study</li>
                                        <li>A diploma after completing 2 years of study</li>
                                        <li>A Bachelor's degree after completion of a 3-year programme</li>
                                        <li>A 4-year multidisciplinary Bachelor's degree (the preferred option)</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <li>The <strong>National Testing Agency</strong> will now be given the additional responsibility of <strong>conducting entrance examinations for admissions to universities across the country</strong>, in addition to the JEE Main and NEET.</li>
                                    <li>To become a Teacher, a <strong>4-year Bachelor of Education</strong> will be the minimum requirement needed by <strong>2030</strong>. The National Council for Teacher Education will frame a <strong>National Curriculum Framework for Teacher Education</strong> by 2021 and a <strong>National Professional Standards for Teachers</strong> by 2022.</li>
                                    <li><strong>National Education Commission</strong>, headed by the Prime Minister of India.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>There are always a few merits & demerits in all the systems. Only thing is that we need to constantly improve the system based on its various outcomes. NEP 2020 is aimed at improving the culture & integrity of the country along with the blend of modernity in the education system & should be considered as the welcome step.</p>
