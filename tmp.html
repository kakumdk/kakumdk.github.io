                                <p>The Indian Farms Reforms of 2020 refer to the <b>agricultural bills</b> passed by the Lok Sabha on 17th September 2020 and by the Rajya Sabha on 20th September 2020. The <b>bills collectively seek to provide farmers with multiple marketing channels and provide a legal framework for farmers to enter into pre-arranged contracts</b> among other things.</p>
                                <p>The President of India gave his assent for the three bills on 27th September 2020.</p>
                                <p>The three acts include</p>
                                <p><b>1. Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Production and Facilitation) Act, 2020</b></p>

                                    <li>Expands the scope of trade areas of farmers' produce from select areas to "any place of production, collection, aggregation".</li>
                                    <li>Allows electronic trading and e-commerce of scheduled farmers' produce.</li>
                                    <li>Prohibits state governments from levying any market fee, cess or levy on farmers, traders, and electronic trading platforms for trade of farmers' produce conducted in an 'outside trade area'.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><b>2. Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020</b></p>
                                <ul class="check">
                                    <li>Provides a legal framework for farmers to enter into pre-arranged contracts with buyers including mention of pricing.</li>
                                    <li>Defines a dispute resolution mechanism.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><b>3. Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020</b></p>
                                <ul class="check">
                                    <li>Removes foodstuff such as cereals, pulses, potato, onions, edible oilseeds and oils, from the list of essential commodities, removing stockholding limits on such items except under "extraordinary circumstances".</li>
                                    <li>Requires that imposition of any stock limit on agricultural produce be based on price rise.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Protests against the acts picked up in September 2020, particularly in Delhi, Punjab and Haryana, where farmers have been at the forefront.</p>
