                                <p>A roof of a building that is <strong>partially or completely covered with vegetation</strong>, that is planted over a waterproofing membrane. It may also include additional layers such as a root barrier and drainage and irrigation systems. <strong>Rooftop ponds</strong> are another form of green roofs which are used to treat greywater.</p>
                                <p><strong>Vegetation, soil, drainage layer, roof barrier and irrigation system</strong> constitute green roof.</p>
                                <p>Green roofs serve several purposes for a building, like absorbing rainwater, providing insulation, creating a habitat for wildlife. They <strong>effectively use the natural functions of plants</strong> to filter water and will have quality air around the home.</p>
                                <div class="ads-page-3"></div>
                                <p>There are many <strong>Environmental benefits of having a Eco friendly roof</strong> for a building.</p>
                                <ul class="check">
                                    <li>Thermal Reduction & Energy Conservation.</li>
                                    <li>Management of Oxygen & CO2 levels naturally.</li>
                                    <li>Ecological benefits.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3>Thermal Reduction & Energy Conservation</h3>
                                <p>Green roofs will <strong>reduce heating by adding mass and thermal resistance value</strong>, also will reduce the heat island by increasing evapotranspiration. Green roofs improve and reduce energy consumption. Green roof <strong>reduces cooling (by evaporative cooling) loads on a building</strong> by fifty to ninety percent.</p>
                                <p>Temperature inside the home will be less than outside during summers & Temperature will be more inside than outside the home in the winters.</p>

                                <h3>Management of Oxygen & CO2 levels naturally</h3>
                                <p>Environmental benefit of greens roofs is the ability to sequester carbon. This <strong>CO2 is naturally absorbed by plant tissue</strong>. The carbon is stored in the plant tissue and the soil substrate through plant litter and root exudates it. Green roofs also indirectly reduce CO2 given off by power plants through their ability to insulate buildings.</p>
                                <h3>Ecological benefits</h3>
                                <p>Green roofs create natural habitat for wild. <strong>Green roofs can attract beneficial insects, birds, bees and butterflies</strong>. Rooftop greenery complements wild areas by providing stepping stones for songbirds, migratory birds and other wildlife creatures.</p>
                                <div class="ads-page-3"></div>
                                <h3>Cons</h3>
                                <ul class="check">
                                    <li>Green roofs <strong>requires bit more maintenance</strong> energy compared to a standard roof. Standard maintenance include removing stones, <strong>controlling weeds, cutting plants</strong> so that it will not grow very big, <strong>checking moisture levels, and fertilizing</strong>.</li>
                                    <li>The maintenance energy use for green roofs <strong>varies on many things like: climate, intensity of rainfall, type of building, type of vegetation, and external coatings</strong>.</li>
                                </ul>





                                <p>Construction process can be tedious, time consuming, and expensive. To overcome this during construction, varied methods of construction is being considered and developed. Also, materials and equipment used for construction are also being fabricated to enhance the quality of construction and furthermore minimize the time and cost. <strong>Interlocking bricks is one such advancement in construction industry</strong>.</p>
                                <p>Interlocking bricks are <strong>enhanced form of conventional clay bricks</strong>. Each brick is designed to lock itself to the other bricks around without the use of much mortar. The self-locking is achieved using shear-key and lock mechanism. Based on the design, the shape of shear-key will vary and a complimentary lock is provided on the opposite side of brick. Load transfer is achieved by shear transfer and gravity.</p>

                                <p>Interlocking bricks are <strong>compressed and stabilized earth bricks which contributes to strength of the structure</strong>.</p>
                                <h3>How Interlocking Bricks are made?</h3>
                                <ul class="check">
                                    <li>These Bricks are made by mixing soil, cement and sand mixture. The finished blocks even stronger than masonry stones.</li>
                                    <li>The soil which is choosen <strong>should not be too sandy, it should actually be lumps and cracks</strong>.</li>
                                    <li>Should not use soil, which is on the surface. It contains too much organics. Organic matter continues to breakdown over time while sand, silt, and clay are much more stable and will not rot away.</li>
                                    <li>Material ratio: <strong>Cement (10%) + Clay (90%) + Water (appropriate)</strong>.</li>
                                    <li>Bricks are cured for 7 - 14 days and it will reach its highest strength after 28 days.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Pros and Cons of these Earth Bricks</h3>
                                <strong>Pros</strong>
                                <ul class="check">
                                    <li>These bricks <strong>result in higher density, which in turn converts itself into high thermal mass</strong>.</li>
                                    <li>No need of plastering or very less plastering.</li>
                                    <li>Interlocking bricks are an effective and proven earthquake resistant construction materials.</li>
                                    <li>Less Labour cost, Less time for construction.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <strong>Cons</strong>
                                <ul class="check">
                                    <li>You can build upto two storey building, more than 2-3 storey building is not recommended.</li>
                                    <li>If rain water enters to the walls, it might be a hostage for insects and other undesired things. Solution for this is, doing minimal plastering for lines & corners</li>
                                </ul>
