Use \"DrupalWebTestCase\"</strong></h4>\n                                <p>A module can have one or more test cases, they can in single file or in many other files</p>\n                                <p>All test files should have am extention as <code>.test</code> and should be named as <code>MODULENAME.test</code></p>\n                                <p>Create your new test case <code>simple_test/tests/simple_test.test</code> file.</p>\n                                <p>All functional tests in Drupal should extend the <code>DrupalWebTestCase</code> class which will provide the utility functions used to drive the test browser, helper functions for interacting with a Drupal application, and all the assertions we will use to perform our actual tests.</p>\n                                <p>Add the below code to your <code>simple_test.test</code>. </p>\n                                <pre>\n  &lt;?php\n\n  class SimpleTest extends DrupalWebTestCase {\n\n  }\n\n</pre><p>Add a <code>getInfo()</code> method to your <code>SimpleTest</code> class. This method returns an array that provides meta-data about our test that the SimpleTest module can use when displaying our test in the UI. This method is required in order for your test to work. This <code>getInfo()</code> method looks like shown below. </p>\n                                <pre>\n  public static function getInfo() {\n    return array(\n      'name' =&gt; 'Simple Test',\n      'description' =&gt; 'Tests for the Simple Test module.',\n      'group' =&gt; 'Simple Test Group',\n    );\n  }\n\n</pre><p>Now add a <code>setUp()</code> method to <code>SimpleTest</code>. This method is called when the system is preparing the environment for running our tests. In this case, we need to ensure that our module is enable during setup so that the page we want to test is available. We can do this by calling the parent classes's setUp() method and passing it an array of modules we want enabled. This <code>setUp()</code> method looks like this</p>\n                                <pre>\n  public function setUp() {\n   parent::setUp(array('simple_test'));\n  }\n\n</pre><p>Add a <code>test*()</code> method to our class. Each test case can have one or more methods whose names are prefixed with the string test. Each of these methods will be automatically called by the SimpleTest test runner, and should contain the various assertions required in order to demonstrate that this test is passing. This example will use the <code>DrupalWebTestCase::drupalGet()</code> method in order to tell the internal browser to navigate to the URL <code>/helloworld</code>. And then use the <code>DrupalWebTestCase::assertText()</code> method to verify that the string, \"Hello World ...\", exists somewhere in the HTML output of the page the internal browser is currently looking at.</p>\n                                <pre>\npublic function test_your_simple_test() {\n  $this-&gt;drupalGet('simple_test');\n  $this-&gt;assertText('Welcome to Drupal. Its simple_test..!', 'The page content is present.');\n}\n\n</pre><p>And last, we need to tell Drupal about our new test.

Its somthing like, write your sass programm, compile it get your css output.</p>\n                                    <h4><strong>Prerquisites</strong></h4>\n                                    <p>We can compile sass into css with tools, in different ways, below i have mention few of these ways (Any of these tools should be installed on your machine).</p>\n                                    <ul>\n                                        <li>You require Ruby installed, then install a gem <code>gem install sass</code> and compile it by running <code>sassc example.scss output.css</code>. </li>\n                                        <li>Or, You can install Compass, and compile by using <code>compass watch example.scss output.css</code>. </li>\n                                        <li>Or,  You can also install libsass via NPM with node-sass <code>npm install node-sass</code>.</li>\n                                    </ul>\n                                    <p>Which one to use, is completelty depends on you, and the project which you are working on</p>\n                                    <p>And Using Sass helps developer writing maintainable CSS easier. You can get more done, in less code, more readably, in less time.</p>\n                                    <h3>Get into detail, how it works</h3>\n                                    <h4><strong>1. Variables</strong></h4>\n                                    <p>Sass brings variables to CSS.</p>\n                                    <p>Acceptable values for variables include numbers, strings, colors, null, lists and maps.</p>\n                                    <p>Variables in Sass are scoped using the $ symbol. Lets create our first variable:</p>\n                                    <pre>$GreyColor: #ccc;</pre><pre>body {\n    background: $GreyColor;\n}\np a {\n   color: $GreyColor;\n}\n\n<strong># Can override the variable value</strong>\nbody {\n    $GreyColor: #aaa;\n    background: $GreyColor;\n}\n\n<strong># \"!global\" which makes the variable value global value.</strong>\nbody {\n    $GreyColor: #aaa !global;\n    background: $GreyColor;\n}\n</pre><p><br></p>\n                                    <h4><strong>2. Math</strong></h4>\n                                    <p>Unlike CSS, Sass allows us to use mathematical expressions</p>\n                                    <p>Before moving forward, I want to make a note of two points with Sass math.</p>\n                                    <p>First, because the / symbol is used in shorthand CSS font properties like font: 14px/16px, if you want to use the division operator on non-variable values, you need to wrap them in parentheses like:</p>\n                                    <pre>$font: (14px/16px);</pre><p>Second, you can’t mix value units, Instead, for this particular example you could use the css calc function</p>\n                                    <pre>$width: 100% - 20px;</pre><p>Now, lets create a dynamic column declaration, based upon a base container width</p>\n                                    <pre>$container-width: 100%;\n.container {\n  width: $container-width;\n}\n.col-4 {\n  width: $container-width / 4;\n}\n\n//  Compiles to:\n//  .container {\n//   width: 100%;\n//  }\n//\n//  .col-4 {\n//      width: 25%;\n//  }\n</pre><p><br></p>\n                                    <h4><strong>3. Functions</strong></h4>\n                                    <p>In my opinion its good to use it’s built in functions. You can see the full list <a href=\"http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html\">here</a>. It is <em>EXTENSIVE</em>.</p>\n                                    <h4><strong>4. Nesting</strong></h4>\n                                    <p>This concept, way of working with this will be understood by seeing the sample code.</p>\n                                    <pre>a.myAnchor {\n    color: blue;\n    &amp;:hover {\n        text-decoration: underline;\n    }\n    &amp;:visited {\n        color: purple;\n    }\n}\n\n// on compiling this we get output as\n// a.myAnchor { color: blue; }\n// a.myAnchor:hover { color: blue; text-decoration: underline; }\n// a.myAnchor:visited { color: purple; }\n</pre><p>\n                                        <br></p>\n                                    <h4><strong>5. Imports</strong></h4>\n                                    <p>through this concept you can break you sass files and include them into single file.</p>\n                                    <pre>@import \"grids.scss\";</pre><p>One more important thing, Sass compilers also include a concept called “partials”. If you prefix a .sass or .scss file with an underscore, it will not get compiled to CSS. This is helpful if your file only exists to get imported into a master style.scss and not explicitly compiled.</p>\n                                    <h4><strong>6. Extends &amp; Placeholders</strong></h4>\n                                    <p>In Sass, the @extend directive is an way to inherit already existing styles.</p>\n                                    <pre>.input {\n  border-radius: 3px;\n  border: 4px solid #ddd;\n  color: #555;\n  font-size: 17px;\n  padding: 10px 20px;\n  display: inline-block;\n  outline: 0;\n}\n\n.error-input {\n  @extend .input;\n  border:4px solid #e74c3c;\n}\n</pre><p>\n                                        <br></p>\n                                    <h4><strong>7. Mixins and Function Directives</strong></h4>\n                                    <p>These are very important things in sass, and can be rapidly used., i will just give one sample about these.</p>\n                                    <pre><strong># mixin</strong>\n.container {\n    width: 900px;\n    @include media(\"(max-width: 767px)\"){\n        width: 100%;\n    }\n}\n\n<strong># function directive</strong>\n@function getColumnWidth($width, $columns,$margin){\n    @return ($width / $columns) - ($margin * 2);\n}\n\n$container-width: 100%;\n$column-count: 4;\n$margin: 1%;\n\n.container {\n  width: $container-width;\n}\n\n.column {\n  background: #1abc9c;\n  height: 200px;\n  display: block;\n  float: left;\n  width: getColumnWidth($container-width,$column-count,$margin);\n  margin: 0 $margin;\n}\n</pre><p>Thank you</p>",

    "content": "<p>Pigeons may be considered rats of the sky, but some scientists have found greater value in these urban birds: <strong>the blueprint for a new generation of flying machines.</strong></p><p>Birds can modify the shape of their wings by fanning out their feathers or shuffling them closer together. Those adjustments allow birds to cut through the sky more nimbly than rigid drones. Now, using new insights into exactly how pigeons joints control the spread of their wing feathers, researchers have built a robotic pigeon, dubbed <strong>PigeonBot</strong>, whose feathered wings change shape like the real deal</p><p>This research paves the way for creating more agile aircraft, says <strong>Dario Floreano, a roboticist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne in Switzerland</strong> not involved in the work.</p><p>With birdlike wings, airborne machines could make tighter turns in cluttered spaces, such as around buildings or in forests, and could better navigate rough air, Floreano says (SN: 1/24/15). The new robot, described January 16 in Science Robotics, also offers a way to study the nuts and bolts of bird flight without animal experiments.</p><p>Researchers bent and extended the wings of dead pigeons to investigate how the birds control their wing shape. Those experiments revealed that the angles of two wing joints, the wrist and the finger, most affect the alignment of a wings flight feathers. The orientations of those long, stiff feathers, which support the bird in flight, help determine the wings shape. Based on those findings, the team built a robot with real pigeon feathers, whose faux wrists and fingers can morph its wing shape as seen in the pigeon cadavers.</p><p>Besides laying the groundwork for building more graceful drones, whats really cool about this robot is  you can make manipulations in a robot wing that you could never do or want to do in a bird to study flight, says <strong>David Lentink, an engineer and biologist at Stanford University.</strong></p><p>For instance, Lentink wondered whether a pigeon could steer itself just by bending the finger joint of either its left or right wing. The problem is, of course, I dont really know how to train a bird to just move its finger  and I actually am very good in bird training, he says by phone, as two pet birds chirp in the background.</p><p>A controllable robotic pigeon solves that problem. In flight tests, Lentinks team observed that bending only the finger of one wing eased the robot into a banked turn  offering the first evidence that birds may sometimes use just their fingers to steer in flight.</p><p>In a second study, reported in the Jan. 17 Science, Lentinks group used their robotic wing design to confirm another insight into bird flight: how gaps are prevented from forming between feathers on extended wings. In experiments that involved rubbing one bird feather across the top of another  to mimic overlapping flight feathers fanning out  researchers found that two feathers initially slid apart easily, but then snagged on each other. Scanning electron and X-ray microscopy images revealed that tiny hooks protruding from the top of one feather latch onto ridges on the underside of the other when they slide too far apart. Those microscopic hooks unfasten when the feathers slot back together.</p><p><strong>Thats the secret. They have this directional Velcro that holds feathers together</strong>, Lentink says.</p><p>To confirm the effect of these microstructures, the researchers rotated the feathers on their robot so that they wouldnt slide against each other when wings were extended. In wind tunnel and outdoor flight tests, gaps formed between feathers on the modified robot wings, undermining the wings stability.</p><p>This is the best set of robotic wings yet for testing how birds coordinate their flight feathers to maneuver through the air, says Tyson Hedrick, a biomechanist the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill not involved in the work. But theres plenty of room for improvement. For instance, a future flying robot could include a shoulder joint, to investigate how tilting a birds wings up and down influences flight, he says.</p>",

Thanks to our colleagues who performed the experiments, we synthesised this hexagonal NaCl, which proves our theory.\"</p><p>To begin with, Tikhomirova and her colleagues used a custom algorithm called USPEX to predict low-energy crystal structures based on the chemical elements used to make them. That in turn led to a hypothesis about the <strong>formation of NaCl structures on top of the diamond layer</strong>.</p><p>In order to prove the hypothesis correct, a series of high-pressure experiments were carried out to create a layer of hexagonal NaCl averaging just 6 nanometres thick - a layer that was verified with X-ray and electron diffraction measurements.</p><p>As soon as the film got any thicker than that, it reverted back to the standard cubic structure of salt - the one you would see if you seasoned your food with it and looked under an ultra-powerful microscope.</p><p>\"<strong>This shows that this simple and common compound, seemingly well-studied, hides many interesting phenomena, especially in nanoscale</strong>,\" says material scientist Alexander Kvashnin.</p><p>Where this might prove most useful is in diamond field-effect transistors or FETs, which can be deployed in a variety of high-powered electronics, including electric vehicles and telecommunications devices.</p><p>These FETs currently rely on hexagonal boron nitride, but hexagonal NaCl is likely to improve the stability of FETs even further (and make them more suitable for a broader range of purposes).</p><p>There's plenty more research ahead, too, not only in developing the hexagonal NaCl structures and the FETs based on them, but also <strong>predicting how exotic structures could be formed from other kinds of compounds</strong>.</p><p>Graphene remains the standard bearer for a 2D material that can exhibit surprising and useful properties, but it's likely that there are many other such discoveries still to come. As methods of modelling and analysis develop, hexagonal salt is likely to be just the start.</p><p>\"Our results show that the <strong>field of 2D materials is still very young, and scientists have discovered only a small portion of possible materials with intriguing properties</strong>,\" says Kvashnin.</p><p>The research has been published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters.</p>",

When someone listens like that, person will feel accepted for who they are. In a relationship both can experience different levels of closeness.</p>\n                                \n                                <p>If you are with someone who is close and is ready to listen and understand what you are sharing which is secret or private for you, then you are the happiest couple.</p>\n                                <p>If you are with someone who is not that close, if you feel so then its your responsibility to sort it like set the boundaries, which can be improved in further time. <strong>End of the day you are dealing with your life partner</strong>.</p>\n                                <h3>Upto what extent I can share?</h3>\n                                <p>Hahaa.. Its difficult, if you are not sure what level of openness is fine or not. This actually depends upon your past experiences, and the person whom you communicate too.</p>\n                                <p>You generally share your most intimate stuff with your romatic partners, <strong>you will tend to create or already have a special bond</strong>, thats unique and only one to say. This is the one which creates strong attachment, a sense of trust & a sense of that partner belongs to you.</p>\n                                \n                                <h3>What if I hold back?</h3>\n                                <p>Here is the relationship starts suffering, when we are holding back. Yes we have right, to have privacy and secrets to ourself, but this is the point where we start loosing the trust, Emotionally we might not be able to show up, It might lead to decrease in the intimacy levels with partner. Its nearly impossible to feel connected.</p>\n                                <h3>Why do you want to hold back?</h3>\n                                <p>Their could be many reasons, may be you have shared something in the past and did not felt safe. This is not something you have to be worried or feared about, You have to move towards more trusting ways so that you can open up to experience the emotional feel of connection.</p>\n                                <h3>Why will I keep it private?</h3>\n                                <p>Keeping private is very individuals choice, It is really not required to share every thought, feeling or an experience. Healthy Adult relationship between couple will be more like have each others space and respect each others privacy.</p>\n                                \n                                <h3>What is the difference? Secret & Privacy</h3>\n                                <p>Having privacy in a relationship might not affect on your relationship, but a secret will surely make any one you hurt.</p>\n                                <p><strong>Lets deal with a example</strong>, If you do not like your partners hairstyle or eating/sleeping habits or friends. If you are keeping it private, then as time goes on this will be a secret which can hurt your relationship.</p>\n                                <p>So <strong>how do you deal with such stuff?</strong> Best way is start revealing part by part to your partner, so that you are getting into same pace with the conflicts with your relationship.</p>\n                                <p>Also keeping something secret from your partner, will feel the partner like in some way you are manipulating. You loose trust, intimacy & emotion between partners.</p>\n                                <p>Finally, what i want to say is.. <strong>we have to learn to give ourself..</strong> In a healthy relationship, we will find the words to convey what we want to share, so that it will be received as a welcomed gift by other.</p>",
