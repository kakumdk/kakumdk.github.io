			<title>What to Know for Estimating Projects</title>
			<link>https://peoplesblog.co.in/articles/what-to-know-for-estimating-projects.html</link>
			<description>Estimating projects is part of project management. And we canâ€™t always estimate a project with 100% accuracy. There will be learning from the failed attempts at estimating projects, maybe with running overtime, or with budget, or with resources etc.
                            If one needs to deliver a project successfully then one must estimate the project as better as possible.
