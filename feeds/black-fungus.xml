			<title>Black Fungus - Detected in Coronavirus Patients</title>
			<link>https://peoplesblog.co.in/articles/black-fungus-detected-in-coronavirus-patients.html</link>
			<description>Black fungus is an infection caused by a fungus named mucormycosis. This fungal infection is being reported in a few Corona-affected patients during or post-recovery.
                                People catch mucormycosis when they come in contact with the fungal spores in the environment. It can also be contacted through skin contact through a cut, burn, or any other form of skin trauma.
