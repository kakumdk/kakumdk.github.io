    "intro": "<p>A keen observer of emotions in people. An explorer of something that is so valid enough but cannot be seen through mere eyes. I believe every human is unique in his or her own thinking pattern or personality. Trying to take tiny steps in the change of outlook towards mental health, I aspire to be a psychologist.</p>\n                                <p>It is thrilling as I realize in my journey that human mind is an unending discovery. I am pursuing my degree in English, Journalism and Psychology. Looking forward to intern in journalism or psychology fields.</p>",
