And Aegir, which gives the best possible approach for Drupal Multisite hosting.</p>\n                                <p>Here you go???</p>\n                                <p>Better Task Queue..! This process is usually handled by \"Supervisor\"</p>\n                                <p>The \"task queue runner\" is just a continuous process that aegir must always have running, so that it can respond to actions on the front-end in a reasonable amount of time.</p>\n                                <p>Upon Docker Container's run, if we have \"drush @hostmaster hosting-queued\" it keeps queued items running.</p>\n                                <p>Starting OR Re-starting Nginx/Apache would be handled by Aegir's \"Verify\" task.</p>\n                                <p>This Could be one of the Future Feature of Aegir..&nbsp;Since, In case of Process Failures.. Docker containers can be back up-running in seconds.</p>\n                                \n                                <p>Faster and Easier Local Development could be made, once the images are downloaded.. Having Development, Preview and Production folders which could individually read each Dockerfiles, this would be next-gen local Drupal development tool..</p>\n                                <p>Have Behat OR Codeception tests to make sure everything is moved between Platforms is tested well..</p>\n                                <p>Travis could be better integration to have the CI in place, with this setup..</p>\n                                <p>In near future, I would get this setup in place.. Stay tuned for more posts on Aegir and Docker..</p>",
