The examples below all use Basic Authentication. Enable the HTTP Basic Authentication module, set the permission for the API user (and role) and set the encoded username and password to the 'Authorization' request header.</p>\n                                <p><strong>Headers</strong></p>\n                                <p>Make sure to use 'Content type' and 'Accept' headers when appropriate</p>\n                                <pre><code>Accept: application/vnd.api+json\nContent-Type: application/vnd.api+json</code>\n</pre><p><strong>Response codes</strong></p>\n                                <p>The JSON:API Specification also dictates&nbsp;acceptable responses. The Drupal implementation uses a subset of those. The module can respond with the following codes:</p>\n                                <ul class=\"check\">\n                                    <li>200 OK - All successful GET and PATCH requests</li>\n                                    <li>201 Created - All successful POST requests (response includes the newly created resource)</li>\n                                    <li>204 No Content - All successful DELETE requests</li>\n                                </ul>\n                                <p>And here's the detailed documentation - <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/jsonapi/get-post-patch-and-delete\">https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/jsonapi/get-post-patch-and-delete</a></p>\n                                <p>And here's the sample postman collection - <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/heykarthikwithu/drupal-jsonapi---sample-api-calls\">https://gitlab.com/heykarthikwithu/drupal-jsonapi---sample-api-calls</a></p>\n                                <p>Thanks :)</p>",
