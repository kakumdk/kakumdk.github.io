    "content": "<p>Reading a book expands your thinking dimensions and gives a better perspective about things going on around you. If you agree with what you read just now, Let's have a look at two books which make significant changes to one's life.</p>\n                                <h4>Life is what you make it by Preeti Shenoy</h4>\n                                <p>This is a wonderful fictional story and it revolves around the protagonist Ankita Sharma.</p>\n                                <p>An insight from this book,</p>\n                                <p><i>The hope that you give can change someone's entire life.</i></p>\n                                <p>From this story, I can say that the hope given by her friend has changed her life. As I proceed to the further pages I could acknowledge that whatever is happening in our lives is not permanent so anything can change at any circumstance.</p>\n                                <div class=\"ads-page-3\"></div>\n                                <h4>The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho</h4>\n                                <p>The story is an allegory about a young shepherd in search of his treasure.</p>\n                                <p>Few motivating thoughts from this book,</p>\n                                <p>When we want something in life, then it's our responsibility to get up and do something about it. Too often in life, we let fate decide our day to day actions and hope all too much that things will work out in the end. But who knows? If we do our part, maybe the universe does so too?</p>\n                                <p>If we get everything we want in life, the minute we want it, then what is the point? Maybe some things aren't meant to come to fruition no matter how hard one tries. But hey? Isn't that what makes it all the more interesting and worth trying for. The possibility that it can come true?</p>\n                                <div class=\"ads-page-3\"></div>\n                                <p>A quote to consider,</p>\n                                <p><i>I don't live in either my past or my future. I'm interested only in the present. If you can concentrate always on the present, you'll be a happy man. Life will be a party for you, a grand festival, because life is the moment we're living now</i> - Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist</p>\n                                <p>Coelho, in this quote, tells us to be more mindful of the present. How we spend our lives and the quality of our lives does depend on the quality of our days.</p>\n                                <p><b>Life goes on, no matter what, taking out time from our busy schedule to do reading activity doesn't go in vain and moreover it improves one's thinking ability.</b></p>",
