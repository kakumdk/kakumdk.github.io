        A government building was set on fire in Manipur's Churachandpur district on Saturday, two days after a gym was vandalised ahead of its inauguration by Chief Minister N Biren Singh. The district administration has imposed a night curfew in the district from 5 pm to 5 am for an indefinite period as the situation remained tense.

          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Chandrayaan-3 launched July 14 on a LVM-3 heavy-lift rocket from Satish Dhawan Space Centre into an initial highly-elliptical Earth orbit.

This began a circuitous journey to the moon which culminated in the lander making the highest latitude lunar landing and making India the fourth country to safely soft land on the moon.

The nominal launch time was however changed after analysis of the orbits of tracked space objects.

Meanwhile, in Kolkata, the West Bengal government said in a statement on Thursday that 18 bodies have been recovered. “Of these, four jawans and two civilians - have been identified,” news agency PTI quoted it. However, it wasn't immediately clear if these jawans were among the 22 missing soldiers, or have died separately.</p>

          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">A 32-year-old Bangladesh national, who claimed to be a Buddhist monk, has been arrested here for trying to travel to Rome on an Indian passport that he had obtained by providing fake documents, an official said on Friday. Bipon Anil Barua, a resident of Bandarban in Bangladesh, was apprehended at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport on Wednesday night, the official said. Barua was to fly to Rome via Muscat from Mumbai in the early hours of Thursday. When an immigration officer keyed in his passport details in their system, he found that a Look Out Circular (LOC) has been issued against him by the Foreigners Registration Office (FRRO), Mumbai, the official said. An LOC is a notice which prevents a person from leaving the country.</p>

Utilising computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, Immersive View merges billions of Street View and aerial images to construct a comprehensive digital representation of the world. The feature puts all the information a user might need in one place. This includes information about real-time traffic, weather updates, bike lanes, complicated intersections, parking, and more. Let us take a look at how Google Maps’ Immersive View for routes will make navigation easier.</p>

          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Khushi Kapoor is all set to make her Bollywood debut with The Archies. She will play Betty Cooper in Zoya Akhtar's film, which is a Hindi adaptation of the iconic Archie Comics. At an event, held earlier in the day, Khushi revealed that she connects with her character in the film and that the two have a lot in common. Khushi said, "I think we were cast because [there] was so much of us that we have in our characters and there's a lot about Betty that I see in myself as well and I think I found that out the more I played her. I think she's very sweet and empathetic but I think she's also sensitive sometimes and she is really caring but I think sometimes she can tend to put other people's needs ahead of her...so I think I identified with certain parts of her a lot like the more I played."

Manoj, without naming the film, said that when Shabana went to watch it, there were a few girls sitting behind her in the theatre who were “making fun” of him. “It was a bad film, bad film. After the film she called me and I asked how she liked the film, and she said, ‘Stop doing films for money. We are not so desperate that you did it for money. It was embarrassing, I felt insulted, humiliated in the theatre, don’t ever do it, please! You are good at stories and characters, please choose them, not these films, you don’t need to prove anything else’,” he shared with Janice Sequeira. Manoj said that it was a “great advice” even though it came in the form of “daantna (scolding)”.</p>

          </h5>
          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Tina Turner, the unstoppable singer and stage performer who teamed with husband Ike Turner for a dynamic run of hit records and live shows in the 1960s and ’70s and survived her horrifying marriage to triumph in middle age with the chart-topping “What’s Love Got to Do With It,” has died at 83. Turner died Tuesday, after a long illness in her home in Küsnacht near Zurich, according to her manager. She became a Swiss citizen a decade ago. Few stars traveled so far — she was born Anna Mae Bullock in a segregated Tennessee hospital and spent her latter years on a 260,000 square foot estate on Lake Zurich — and overcame so much. Physically battered, emotionally devastated and financially ruined by her 20-year relationship with Ike Turner, she became a superstar on her own in her 40s, at a time when most of her peers were on their way down, and remained a top concert draw for years after.</p>

As per a report in Times of India, the Indian contingent, which is currently training in Hyderabad, has a flight booked for 10th May to travel to China from Bengaluru. The Badminton Association of India (BAI) has reportedly escalated this matter to the Badminton World Federation (BWF) under whose aegis the Sudirman Cup is hosted. What is to be noted here is the fact that the Chinese contingent had faced a similar issue while travelling to India for the 2023 India Open earlier in the year. But, this issue was duly solved following the intervention of BAI</p>

          </h5>
          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Chandrayaan-3 launched July 14 on a LVM-3 heavy-lift rocket from Satish Dhawan Space Centre into an initial highly-elliptical Earth orbit.

This began a circuitous journey to the moon which culminated in the lander making the highest latitude lunar landing and making India the fourth country to safely soft land on the moon.

          </h5>
          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">A Cornell-led collaboration harnessed chemical reactions to make microscale origami machines self-fold – freeing them from the liquids in which they usually function, so they can operate in dry environments and at room temperature. The approach could one day lead to the creation of a new fleet of tiny autonomous devices that can rapidly respond to their chemical environment. The group’s paper, “Gas-Phase Microactuation Using Kinetically Controlled Surface States of Ultrathin Catalytic Sheets,” was published on May 1 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The paper’s co-lead authors are Nanqi Bao, Ph.D. ’22, and former postdoctoral researcher Qingkun Liu, Ph.D. ’22.</p>

          </h5>
          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">A study has found widespread mass loss of glaciers and ice caps in Greenland since the start of the 20th century. The research provides critical insights into long-term changes to the glaciers and ice caps as a result of climate change, which has contributed about one fifth to global sea-level rise in the last decade. Using historical data, scientists mapped 5,327 glaciers and ice caps that existed at the end of the Little Ice Age in 1900, a period of wide-spread cooling when average global temperatures dropped by as much as 2°C. They were then able to reveal that these fragmented into 5,467 glaciers and ice caps by 2001. The study – Mass Loss of Glaciers and Ice Caps Across Greenland Since the Little Ice Age – published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, said Greenland’s glaciers have lost at least 587 km3 of ice over the last century, accounting for 1.38 millimetres of sea-level rise.</p>

          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Days after the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that COVID-19 was no longer a global health emergency, marking an end to the pandemic that claimed millions of lives, experts fear that “Disease X” can lead to an “even deadlier” pandemic. According to the WHO, “Disease X represents the knowledge that a serious international epidemic could be caused by a pathogen currently unknown to cause human disease.” The term, which was coined in 2018, is on WHO’s shortlist of ‘priority diseases’. To prevent and tackle the outbreak of Disease X, experts are clamouring for a rise in funds to support the surveillance of, and research into, potential pandemic agents, according to a report in the New York Post.</p>

          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">The World Health Organization on May 15 released a new guideline that recommends against the use of non-sugar sweeteners to control body weight or reduce the risk of non-communicable diseases. The Geneva-based WHO based the recommendation on a systemic review of available evidence, which suggests the use of non-sugar sweeteners does not confer any long-term benefit in reducing body fat in adults or children. The review also suggested the long-term use of non-sugar sweeteners potentially may have undesirable effects such as an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and mortality in adults.</p>

          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Anticipating a spurt in the number of dengue cases after a week or so, the Health Department has intensified control measures in Coimbatore district. The counter measures are primarily aimed at preventing the breeding of aedes aegypti mosquito, the primary vector of the virus causing dengue. P. Aruna, Deputy Director of Health Services, Coimbatore district, said the spurt was anticipated as the district received good spells of summer showers. “Chances of an increase in the breeding of mosquitoes are high as the rains have stopped. Health inspectors have been instructed to contact administrations of temples, mosques and churches to circulate village-specific awareness messages. Health inspectors have been asked to tie-up with scrap dealers who will collect waste materials, which may turn breeding ground for mosquitoes. The scrap dealers will visit a specific day in a village to collect such materials,” she said</p>

          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Tension spread in Kurnool early on Monday morning as CBI officials reached Kurnool after YSR Congress Kadapa MP YS Avinash Reddy rejected CBI's summons in connection with the Vivekananda Reddy murder case. Avinash sought five more days from the CBI as his mother is currently hospitalised. The CBI team moved early morning probably to arrest Avinash who was at the Vishwa Bharati Hospital where his mother is hospitalised. A huge number of party workers gathered at the hospital to prevent the arrest.</p>
