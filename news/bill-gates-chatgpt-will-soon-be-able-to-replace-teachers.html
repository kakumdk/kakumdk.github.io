        During the ASU+GSV event in San Diego, Gates estimated that AI chatbots like ChatGPT will be able to help children learn to read and write in the next 18 months. This would be a more economical solution for many disadvantaged parents who cannot afford a human teacher. Gates believes that AI-powered chatbots will become as good as any human tutor and will engage in a dialogue to help students understand their shortcomings.

          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">As Indians celebrated Diwali 2023 with great aplomb, spirits heightened but air qualities plummeted. Fortunately, rains are slowly showing up in different parts of the country, acting like a post-Diwali clean-up crew tasked with ridding the air of pollutants. After South India, these showers are all set to drench the eastern parts of our country starting tomorrow. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), a cyclonic circulation has aided the formation of a low-pressure area over the southeast Bay of Bengal and adjoining Andaman-Nicobar Islands. The ambitious system is set to traverse west-northwestwards, intensifying into a depression over the west-central Bay of Bengal around November 16. Meanwhile, another cyclonic circulation sits atop the southwest Bay of Bengal. Under the collective influence of these systems, light to moderate showers are expected in the coastal districts of Gangetic West Bengal and Odisha from Wednesday, November 15. These rains will be accompanied by isolated heavy spells (64.5 mm-115.5 mm) starting Thursday, November 16.</p>

Al-Shifa, Gaza's largest hospital, has been the focal point for the Israeli military after it was claimed that the complex has a Hamas command chamber located underneath thousands of ailing and sheltering civilians. Seasoned troops of Israel Defence Forces (IDF), in their over two weeks-long ground incursion into the beseiged enclave, have entered the Shifa hospital.

According to the WHO, “Disease X represents the knowledge that a serious international epidemic could be caused by a pathogen currently unknown to cause human disease.” The term, which was coined in 2018, is on WHO’s shortlist of ‘priority diseases’. To prevent and tackle the outbreak of Disease X, experts are clamouring for a rise in funds to support the surveillance of, and research into, potential pandemic agents, according to a report in the New York Post.</p>

          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">The World Health Organization on May 15 released a new guideline that recommends against the use of non-sugar sweeteners to control body weight or reduce the risk of non-communicable diseases. The Geneva-based WHO based the recommendation on a systemic review of available evidence, which suggests the use of non-sugar sweeteners does not confer any long-term benefit in reducing body fat in adults or children. The review also suggested the long-term use of non-sugar sweeteners potentially may have undesirable effects such as an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and mortality in adults.</p>
