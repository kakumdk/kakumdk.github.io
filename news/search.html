                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Arriving on limited screens [550] and shows, the need of the hour was this Friday’s release Thank You For Coming was to take a start of over 1 crore. That was a bare minimum requirement for this s*x comedy, a genre that has not been tried for a long time in Bollywood. Yes, there was Masti and Kya Kool… series that used to be successful a decade or so back, but over a period of time, they fizzled out. Now, the latest release is not as explicit as these films were but is bold in its own way and does make quite a few statements.  Hence, a start of 1.06 crores, which has come in, is fair enough, and what one waits to see is the kind of jumps that it takes from here. Ideally, the film should double up today, and the 2 crores mark is crossed so that it can set the base for tomorrow. As it is, there is India’s first World Cup ODI match tomorrow with Australia, and hence growth may be limited. Hence, to gain an opening weekend of over 5 crores, a day of 2 crores today is required</p>

A report by news agency AFP stated that sirens warning of incoming fire blared in Israel.  Hamas Armed Wing said that over 5,000 rockets fired as ‘Operation Al-Aqsa Flood’ began. An Israel Defense Force (IDF) soldier has reportedly been kidnapped. Hostage situations have been reported in Southern Israel.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Chandrayaan-3 launched July 14 on a LVM-3 heavy-lift rocket from Satish Dhawan Space Centre into an initial highly-elliptical Earth orbit.  This began a circuitous journey to the moon which culminated in the lander making the highest latitude lunar landing and making India the fourth country to safely soft land on the moon.  The nominal launch time was however changed after analysis of the orbits of tracked space objects.   .</p>

At an event, held earlier in the day, Khushi revealed that she connects with her character in the film and that the two have a lot in common. Khushi said, I think we were cast because [there] was so much of us that we have in our characters and there's a lot about Betty that I see in myself as well and I think I found that out the more I played her. I think she's very sweet and empathetic but I think she's also sensitive sometimes and she is really caring but I think sometimes she can tend to put other people's needs ahead of her...so I think I identified with certain parts of her a lot like the more I played. </p>

Manoj, without naming the film, said that when Shabana went to watch it, there were a few girls sitting behind her in the theatre who were “making fun” of him. “It was a bad film, bad film. After the film she called me and I asked how she liked the film, and she said, ‘Stop doing films for money. We are not so desperate that you did it for money. It was embarrassing, I felt insulted, humiliated in the theatre, don’t ever do it, please! You are good at stories and characters, please choose them, not these films, you don’t need to prove anything else’,” he shared with Janice Sequeira. Manoj said that it was a “great advice” even though it came in the form of “daantna (scolding)”.</p>

The approach could one day lead to the creation of a new fleet of tiny autonomous devices that can rapidly respond to their chemical environment. The group’s paper, “Gas-Phase Microactuation Using Kinetically Controlled Surface States of Ultrathin Catalytic Sheets,” was published on May 1 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">A study has found widespread mass loss of glaciers and ice caps in Greenland since the start of the 20th century. The research provides critical insights into long-term changes to the glaciers and ice caps as a result of climate change, which has contributed about one fifth to global sea-level rise in the last decade. Using historical data, scientists mapped 5,327 glaciers and ice caps that existed at the end of the Little Ice Age in 1900, a period of wide-spread cooling when average global temperatures dropped by as much as 2°C. They were then able to reveal that these fragmented into 5,467 glaciers and ice caps by 2001. The study – Mass Loss of Glaciers and Ice Caps Across Greenland Since the Little Ice Age – published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, said Greenland’s glaciers have lost at least 587 km3 of ice over the last century, accounting for 1.38 millimetres of sea-level rise.</p>

                </h5>
                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">A group of Indian scientists has made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of artificial light harvesting. Inspired by the natural process of photosynthesis, the researchers from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata and the S N Bose National Center for Basic Sciences (SNBNCBS), Kolkata, developed a novel method using organic fluorescent molecule and a therapeutically important biopolymer. These organic nanotubes have a range of potential applications, including solar cells, photo catalysis, optical sensors, and tunable multi-color light-emitting materials. Similar to how plants use chlorophyll to convert sunlight into energy, the scientists utilized the organic nanotube to absorb artificial light and transfer the energy to a dye molecule such as Nile Red and Nile Blue. The dye molecule then emits  color tuning from initial greenish-yellow to orange-red, including white light.</p>

                </h5>
                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">What would happen if a genetically engineered spider bit a human being? Could Spider-Man really do everything a spider can? The science isn’t all baloney. Spider silk is truly one of the world’s most impressive biomaterials. It’s a protein made from compounds secreted by up to seven different glands, with the average spider having at least three. Each strand is made up thousands of nanostrands, making spider silk five times stronger than steel of the same width, researchers from the US’s College of William and Mary have found. Their study was published in the journal ACS Macro Letters in 2018.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">“The formation of reactive organic molecules to form the building blocks of life on the nascent Earth is one of the prerequisites for abiogenesis,” Professor Trapp and colleagues said. “The emergence of a stable continental crust and liquid water on the Earth at 4.4 billion years ago, and the earliest biogenic carbon isotope signatures at 3.8-4.1 billion years ago suggest that life originated only 400-700 million years after the formation of the Earth.” “This relatively short time span indicates that the major part of organic precursors has been already formed on the Hadean Earth as early as 4.4 billion years ago.”</p>

That’s despite Jupiter also being a gas rather than a rocky planet and about 11 times Earth’s diameter. The unlikely truth about Jupiter’s lightning—giant sparks of electricity in its atmosphere—has been uncovered by researchers looking at five years’ worth of data from NASA’s spacecraft Juno. It has been orbiting the giant planet since mid-2016.</p>

The Artemis program aims to land the first woman and the next man on the lunar surface by 2024, with subsequent missions focusing on establishing a sustainable human presence on the Moon. As part of this ambitious endeavour, NASA recognizes the need for an advanced lunar rover that Artemis astronauts will drive to explore and sample more of the lunar surface than they could on foot.</p>

The smallsats were deployed at 12:20 am EDT on May 26. Signal for the first CubeSat was acquired at 1:16 a.m. EDT and at 2:19 a.m. for the second. Through this mission, NASA will study tropical cyclones and aims to improve forecasting for hurricanes and typhoons. “As a lifelong Floridian, I know firsthand how critical it is for millions of Americans to have timely and accurate forecasts for hurricanes. More intense rainfall and increased coastal flooding are devastating livelihoods and taking lives, demonstrating the importance of NASA’s cutting-edge science to help answer questions that nobody else can,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “With missions like TROPICS, NASA continues to lead the way in getting satellite data more quickly to our partners like the National Hurricane Center and Joint Typhoon Warning Center, providing vital forecasts that help our communities before, during, and after landfall.”</p>

Bipon Anil Barua, a resident of Bandarban in Bangladesh, was apprehended at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport on Wednesday night, the official said. Barua was to fly to Rome via Muscat from Mumbai in the early hours of Thursday. When an immigration officer keyed in his passport details in their system, he found that a Look Out Circular (LOC) has been issued against him by the Foreigners Registration Office (FRRO), Mumbai, the official said. An LOC is a notice which prevents a person from leaving the country.</p>

According to the WHO, “Disease X represents the knowledge that a serious international epidemic could be caused by a pathogen currently unknown to cause human disease.” The term, which was coined in 2018, is on WHO’s shortlist of ‘priority diseases’. To prevent and tackle the outbreak of Disease X, experts are clamouring for a rise in funds to support the surveillance of, and research into, potential pandemic agents, according to a report in the New York Post.</p>

A video shows how he ignored the icy temperatures and plugged into the water without hesitation when he saw the pooch struggling. His act of kindness was also captured on camera and later shared on Instagram. The rescue video has left people with a warm feeling in their hearts. Holly Morphew originally captured the video and shared it back in February. “Yesterday my friend and I went for a walk around Sloan’s Lake. We saw a dog take off from the opposite side of the lake full speed ahead chasing geese. We watched in horror knowing the ice would soon run out. It did, and the dog went down into the lake. It struggled for a long time as we helplessly looked on, praying it could break enough ice to get to the shore. But it was getting tired and we could see the struggle wasn’t going to last much longer. We called 911 and the fire department was on its way. We weren’t sure their rescue would be fast enough. Then, a #hero took off his clothes and went in to save it. I am so happy to say he did, and both he and the dog were ok. This man saved a dog’s life yesterday and for that I am so thankful. Thank you to those who act #selflessly. He definitely did risk his life to save another,” she wrote.</p>

In a letter to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, cited by CNBC US, Yellen wrote, “We now estimate that the Treasury will have insufficient resources to satisfy the government’s obligations if Congress has not raised or suspended the debt limit by June 5.” Yellen’s letter comes at a time when tensions have built over whether a deal between the White House and Republicans in Congress will be struck in time as the so-called “X-date” draws close. Last time, the date was updated on May 1. Yellen had then said the US had enough cash available to meet its obligations until “early June, and potentially as early as June 1.”</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy was informed about the death of his uncle and former minister YS Vivekananda Reddy much before the news became public, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) told a court on Friday. The probe agency made the revelation in an affidavit before the Telangana High Court in response to an anticipatory bail petition filed by Kadapa MP YS Avinash Reddy, a member of the Chief Minister's party, who has been named an accused in the case. Avinash Reddy's father Bhaskar Reddy, who was arrested in connection with the case last month, was shifted to a hospital this morning.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">In a democracy, the people are sovereign. But this abstract notion of popular sovereignty has a concrete manifestation. That is the Parliament of India, for it is here that, through their representatives, the citizens of India exercise their sovereignty. And with a new Parliament building on the cusp of being inaugurated, Indian citizens are about to move to a new home. Indeed, it is in Parliament, over the last seven decades, that India’s citizens have expressed their political preferences. They have kept the executive in check and made it accountable through relentless questions and votes. They have framed laws. They have debated fiercely.</p>

The office of the Chief Justice of Himachal Pradesh High Court has been vacant since January this year after the retirement of Chief Justice Amjad Sayed. The Supreme Court Collegium headed by CJI DY Chandrachud had recommended Justice Rao's elevation last month. It had reasoned that the Telangana High Court (Justice Rao's parent High Court), presently has no representation among Chief Justices of the High Courts.</p>

The events were triggered by a article by S Gurumurthy in Thuglak magazine on 5 May 2021 that said the 'Sengol' was a symbol of Independence given to India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru by a Tamil pontiff.</p>

At least 21 opposition parties have decided to boycott the PM's decision to preside over the inauguration ceremony instead of President Droupadi Murmu. The opposition said that the inauguration of the building without President Droupadi Murmu insults the high office of the President, and violates the letter and spirit of the Constitution. Meanwhile, amid the boycott call by the opposition, the Centre has received a confirmed list of 25 political parties, including some which are not a part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), that will participate in the inauguration ceremony.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Tina Turner, the unstoppable singer and stage performer who teamed with husband Ike Turner for a dynamic run of hit records and live shows in the 1960s and ’70s and survived her horrifying marriage to triumph in middle age with the chart-topping “What’s Love Got to Do With It,” has died at 83. Turner died Tuesday, after a long illness in her home in Küsnacht near Zurich, according to her manager. She became a Swiss citizen a decade ago. Few stars traveled so far — she was born Anna Mae Bullock in a segregated Tennessee hospital and spent her latter years on a 260,000 square foot estate on Lake Zurich — and overcame so much. Physically battered, emotionally devastated and financially ruined by her 20-year relationship with Ike Turner, she became a superstar on her own in her 40s, at a time when most of her peers were on their way down, and remained a top concert draw for years after.</p>

When asked about the likelihood the U.S. could get to June 15 “to avoid breaching the debt ceiling,” Yellen said: “There’s always uncertainty about tax receipts and spending. And so it’s hard to be absolutely certain about this, but my assessment is that the odds of reaching June 15th, while being able to pay all of our bills, is quite low.”</p>

President Biden and the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives Kevin McCarthy have held three rounds of face-to-face talks to try and reach a deal to lift the current borrowing limit so the US can meet its existing spending commitments. Invoking the 14th Amendment to the constitution, which some legal scholars have argued would allow the US Treasury to simply ignore the debt limit, is not going to fix the current problem we have right now, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters.</p>

The decision, also announced by Canada's foreign ministry, came after talks last year between Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the sidelines of the summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum in Bangkok. It has been decided to restore the level of diplomatic relations with Canada to its previous state, Saudi's foreign ministry said in a statement.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Astock market broker was arrested in Hyderabad on Wednesday for allegedly killing a 55-year-old woman with whom he was in an illicit relationship. The 48-year-old man was arrested following a week-long investigation, initiated after the discovery of the victim’s severed head in a dumping yard. According to the police, the motive behind the crime was reportedly related to debts amounting to Rs 7 lakh that the accused, identified as Chandramohan, owed to the victim, Yarram Anuradha Reddy. The police said while Chandramohan was a bachelor, Anuradha was a widow who worked as a nurse in a hospital after her husband passed away several years ago. As a result of their association, the accused had provided accommodation to the deceased in a portion of his ground floor residence. The two were in an illicit relationship for over 15 years.</p>

Providing an update on the progress of the MTHL, Fadnavis, who drove on the sea bridge, said it is “almost ready.” The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) has completed the Mumbai-bound carriageway of the project, also known as the Sewri-Nhava Sheva Trans Harbour Link, a six-lane access-controlled expressway grade road bridge. The bridge begins in Sewri in south Mumbai and terminates at Chirle near Nhava Sheva. The Mumbai Trans Harbour Link will be the longest sea bridge in the country with a total stretch of 16.5 km above the sea. The bridge connecting Mumbai with Navi Mumbai is expected to provide major relief to commuters in Mumbai Metropolitan Region by mitigating traffic congestion, and also promote economic development. It will allow people to travel from Sewri in central Mumbai to Chirle in Navi Mumbai in 15 to 20 minutes.</p>

Speaking at a press conference in Hiroshima, Japan, where the Group of Seven summit meeting had been held, Guterres said both institutions reflected the power relations of 1945 and needed to be updated.</p>

                </h5>
                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">In March 2021, the Quad (Australia, India, Japan, and the United States) set up a Critical and Emerging Technology Working Group to facilitate cooperation, monitor trends, and scout for opportunities related to developments in critical and emerging technologies, that included biotechnology. However, the potential for Quad cooperation in biotechnology remains insufficiently tapped. The establishment of a Quad-led biomanufacturing hub in India will give the necessary fillip to enhance this cooperation. (The writers have examined this proposal with researchers at the Australian National University.) Biomanufacturing uses living systems, particularly microorganisms and cell cultures, to produce molecules and materials on a commercial scale. It has the potential to transform the global industrial system, with up to 60% of physical inputs to the global economy expected to be producible using this technology. Many countries, including the United States and China, recognise the need to optimise this ecosystem and have designed specific policies to shape their bio-economies.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">If one has to summarise the four-and-a-half decades-long operational history in numbers, the F-16 Fighting Falcon, since its first flight in 1979, has seen over 30,000 worldwide air-to-air and air-to-ground combat sorties. In an operational career of four and a half decades, the combat jet has seen 154 engagements that have resulted in at least 210 confirmed kills with two combat losses and four fratricides. The compact, single-engine, multi-role fighter aircraft has proved its mettle in air-to-air combat and air-to-surface attacks. The fourth-generation fighter jet has maneuverability and combat radius (the distance it can fly to enter combat, fight, and return) greater than most potential adversaries. It can locate targets in all weather conditions and detect low-flying aircraft in radar ground clutter.</p>

The study published in the journal Nature finds that modern humans descended from at least two populations. A new study published in the journal Nature has recently discovered that modern humans evolved from atleast two places in Africa. The was conducted by the researchers at Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany and Eleanor Scerri states that there is “no single birthplace in Africa, and that human evolution is a process with very deep African roots”</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">The South African contingent at King Charles III’s coronation, which included singer Pretty Yende and minister Naledi Pandor, was further enhanced by the presence of the Cullinan diamond, the largest rough diamond ever discovered. The diamond was originally purchased during South Africa's colonial rule in 1905 and was gifted to King Edward VII in 1907. Subsequently, the diamond was cut into nine pieces and 97 fragments, with the largest of these pieces, Cullinan 2, also known as the Star of Africa, being set on a sceptre presented to Charles during his coronation. The other pieces are either on display in the Tower of London or the possession of the British royal family. Currently, there are demands from South African citizens to have the Cullinan diamonds returned as part of a larger movement to repatriate cultural artefacts. However, the task is not straightforward as the diamonds are currently in the possession of the British royal family, and there are legal and diplomatic issues that must be addressed before they can be returned.</p>

The International Union for Conservation of Nature‘s Red List, also known as IUCN Red List, is the world’s most comprehensive inventory of the global conservation status of plant and animal species.</p>

                </h5>
                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">With Turkey’s presidential and parliamentary elections heading into a run-off vote on May 28th, Erdogan has the new god of selective censorship (Elon Musk on his Twitter throne) on his side, and he could end up winning the second-round vote with a stability argument. Financial markets seem to be fairly confident that Erdogan will win. This is clear with a weakening of Turkish financial assets as the market prepares for another five-year term for the near-autocrat and his extremely unorthodox economic policies. While Erdogan won 49.51% in Sunday’s presidential vote, and CHP candidate Kemal Kilicdaroglu won 45%, it was only enough for a run-off vote, with the winner requiring over 50%. However, in the parliamentary vote, Erdogan’s AKP and partners won 322 of the 600 seats up for grabs, which means he will control parliament regardless. The argument that is likely to resonate with many Turkish voters is the one Erdogan is making sure is circulated incessantly: Because his party already will control parliament, a CHP president would introduce instability and potentially paralyze the government. Voting for Erdogan in the second round, then, is being billed as the only path to stability.</p>

                </h5>
                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">THE RESERVE Bank of India (RBI) Friday announced the withdrawal of its highest value currency note, Rs 2,000, from circulation, adding that the notes will continue to be legal tender. It said the existing Rs 2,000 notes can be deposited or exchanged in banks until September 30, but set a limit of “Rs 20,000 at a time”. The central bank advised the public to deposit Rs 2,000 notes — introduced during demonetisation in November 2016, when Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were withdrawn — into their bank accounts and/ or exchange them into notes of other denominations at any bank branch. It also advised banks to stop issuing Rs 2,000 notes with immediate effect.</p>

Recently, an IT worker sued her boss for sending xx on emails. In millennial lingo, xx means hugs and kisses, something that we use only on WhatsApp or text messages, primarily for friends, family members and loved ones. However, when the female employee received it from her boss on the work email, she was not very happy about it.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">The long wait for green cards for people from India, China and other countries is mainly due to the country-based quota system, a senior official said as per news agency PTI. Its allocation can be changed only by the US Congress, the official added. A Green Card- Permanent Resident Card- is issued to immigrants to the US as evidence that they have been granted the permission of residing permanently in the country. Every country has limits on the issuance of green cards to individuals. US immigration law provides for approximately 140,000 employment-based green cards to be issued each year- of which only seven per can go to individuals from a single country.</p>

With Pakistan President and apex judiciary overtly revealing their soft corner towards Niazi and tying the hands of Sharif government, the Pakistan Army under General Asim Munir has started the process of dismantling the PTI and isolating their mercurial leader in the past days. Feeling the heat from the Army and the ISI, described once by former PM Benazir Bhutto as a state within the state, several powerful party office-bearers close to Niazi have either left the party or are in the process of doing so in the coming days.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">The World Health Organization on May 15 released a new guideline that recommends against the use of non-sugar sweeteners to control body weight or reduce the risk of non-communicable diseases. The Geneva-based WHO based the recommendation on a systemic review of available evidence, which suggests the use of non-sugar sweeteners does not confer any long-term benefit in reducing body fat in adults or children. The review also suggested the long-term use of non-sugar sweeteners potentially may have undesirable effects such as an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and mortality in adults.</p>

                </h5>
                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Anticipating a spurt in the number of dengue cases after a week or so, the Health Department has intensified control measures in Coimbatore district. The counter measures are primarily aimed at preventing the breeding of aedes aegypti mosquito, the primary vector of the virus causing dengue. P. Aruna, Deputy Director of Health Services, Coimbatore district, said the spurt was anticipated as the district received good spells of summer showers. “Chances of an increase in the breeding of mosquitoes are high as the rains have stopped. Health inspectors have been instructed to contact administrations of temples, mosques and churches to circulate village-specific awareness messages. Health inspectors have been asked to tie-up with scrap dealers who will collect waste materials, which may turn breeding ground for mosquitoes. The scrap dealers will visit a specific day in a village to collect such materials,” she said</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">The first full-sized 3D scan of the Titanic shipwreck published on Wednesday may reveal more details about the ocean liner's fateful journey across the Atlantic more than a century ago. The high-resolution images, published by the BBC, reconstruct the wreck that lies at a depth of nearly 4,000 metres (13,100 feet) in great detail and were created using deep-sea mapping. The luxury passenger liner sank after colliding with an iceberg on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York in April 1912, leaving more than 1,500 dead.</p>

Police said a NIA team started the search at about 6am at a house linked to Gurvinder Singh, who lives in Canada and is currently in the country to visit his family.

EU foreign and security policy chief Josep Borrell said on Tuesday that Brussels is aware Indian refiners are buying large volumes of Russian crude oil and processing it into fuels for sale in Europe. For the first time since India significantly ramped up purchases of discounted Russian oil, Borrell also said the EU should act to stop this practice.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">A 71-year-old man allegedly hired two contract killers to kill his 35-year-old wife in West Delhi's Rajouri Garden. The killers stabbed the woman to death on Wednesday around 2.30 pm, police said. The woman’s body was found at her residence with multiple stab wounds. SK Gupta got married to the woman in November last year, a senior police officer said. He wanted her wife to take care of his son Amit (45), who is physically challenged and also has cerebral palsy, but she refused to do so. The man then decided to get separated from his wife but she demanded Rs 1 crore to divorce him, according to the investigation.</p>

Indeed, he stressed that judicial appointment is not a function of the judiciary and that its primary role is to decide cases.</p>

According to officials, Quad is not a gang up of democratic powers against China but all about mutual economic, technological and security cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. That the belligerence of the Xi Jinping regime in the Indo-Pacific is one of the foundation pillars of Quad, there is no doubt. While US President Biden is also expected to meet PM Modi on the side-lines of the G-7 summit, the two countries along with Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates will announce an MoU very soon on regional integration of the Middle East with road and rail infrastructure as an alternative to China’s Belt Road Initiative (BRI). Decision to this effect was taken in a meeting between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Deputy Ruler of UAE Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Indian National Security Advisor Ajit Doval on May 7.</p>

The decree applies to foreign citizens who enter into contracts with the Russian army for a period of one year. Those individuals and their family members who serve in the army will be able to apply for Russian citizenship without the need to obtain a residence permit. This follows legislation in Russia which included a requirement for applicants to be involved in hostilities in Ukraine for at least six months.</p>

The film is set for release on the 5th of April, 2024. The shooting is progressing at a brisk pace now.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Manoj Bajpayee-starrer Sirf Ek Bandaa Kaafi Hai dropped on Monday and it has created quite a buzz. Said to be ‘inspired’ by true events, it features the star as a passionate lawyer, fighting against a godman who is accused of raping a minor. Self-styled godman Asaram Bapu, who is currently serving a life sentence, after being convicted of a similar crime, has now slapped the makers with a legal notice. Asaram, through his charitable trust, has sent a legal notice on the makers and has asked the courts to issue “prohibitory orders against the promotion and release of the film.” They have termed the film “highly objectionable” and “defamatory” towards their client and has the potential to “tarnish his reputation and hit sentiments of his devotees.”</p>

Utilising computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, Immersive View merges billions of Street View and aerial images to construct a comprehensive digital representation of the world. The feature puts all the information a user might need in one place. This includes information about real-time traffic, weather updates, bike lanes, complicated intersections, parking, and more. Let us take a look at how Google Maps’ Immersive View for routes will make navigation easier.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Mosquitos are the silent insidious enemies which are present everywhere across India and, therefore, a mosquito bite cannot be termed an 'accident' for claiming compensation under an accident insurance policy, the Calcutta High Court recently held [Chitra Mukherjee vs Union of India]. Single-judge Justice Moushumi Bhattacharya dismissed the plea filed by the mother of a serving army man, who died at a hospital on December 20, 2021 after contracting Dengue.

To prevail, Trump would have to show Kaplan incorrectly applied the law in various rulings and that this deprived him of a fair trial.</p>

The 48-year-old woman, Lillian, survived on a bottle of wine and lollipops. Victoria Police reported that Lillian’s vehicle was stuck in mud after she took a wrong turn and reached a dead-end road. Since there was no mobile coverage in the area, Lillian could not request assistance. After Lillian failed to make her daily call to her loved ones, they became concerned and alerted the authorities. This lead to extensive police searches that eventually led to her location.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Pakistan, a close partner of China since the 1960s and a major recipient of Chinese lending, has been in the midst of a political crisis since the removal of Prime Minister Imran Khan last year in a vote of no confidence. The conflict includes not just Khan and the current coalition government led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, but also the courts and army. On Saturday, Khan once again accused a senior intelligence officer of being behind the failed assassination attempt on him last year. Today, the military’s chief spokesman shot back, describing his allegations as “baseless” and “unacceptable.”</p>

                </h5>
                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">India last week hosted a meeting of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Foreign Ministers in Goa, which was marked by both the quest of the multilateral organisation to deepen economic cooperation and bilateral tensions between its prominent members. The meeting, a prelude to the SCO summit to be held in New Delhi in July, took place amid heightened tensions between Russia and the West over the former’s invasion of Ukraine and disruption in global payment systems due to the West’s sanctions on Moscow. The Foreign Ministers meeting agreed to strengthen cooperation in a number of areas, including economic and technological spheres. India’s proposals on making English an additional official language to Russian and Chinese at the SCO, and setting up working groups on innovation, start-ups and traditional medicines are being discussed, New Delhi said. But tensions between India and Pakistan and frosty ties between India and China over border problems overshadowed the meeting.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">The incident went unnoticed on social media until the Kremlin disclosed it around 12 hours later. Moscow clarified that President Putin was absent at the Kremlin during the incident. However, questions remain about how the two drones breached the security of one of the most fortified buildings in Moscow’s city center. Opinions on the incident vary among analysts, with some proposing that the attack could be a false flag operation orchestrated by Russia, while others speculating it might be a deliberate symbolic act by Ukraine, targeting a prominent symbol of Russian state power.</p>

Seeking to cement public support for his struggling 14-month-old attack on his neighbor, Putin claimed troops at the front have the fate of Russia in their hands. Ukraine and its allies in the US and Europe reject the Kremlin’s portrayal of the war, saying they’re seeking only to eject Russian forces from Kyiv’s territory.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Actor Lisa Ray says she wants to be free of her association with iconic Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan song Afreen Afreen. A mix between indie pop and fusion music, the 1996 ghazal track was sung and composed by Khan with lyrics by Javed Akhtar. Lisa Ray, who was a model when she featured in the music video, said she inwardly cringes whenever the song is played as part of her introduction at public events. I have to confess I have felt uncomfortable sharing or celebrating the Afreen Afreen breakthrough video of the 90s and iconic song by maestro #nusratfatehalikhan because I was so strongly identified with it, the 51-year-old said in an Instagram.</p>

                </h5>
                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Ever since the meteorologists flagged the possibility of Cyclone Mocha, it has generated quite a buzz mainly due to its unique name. The name 'Mocha', recommended by Yemen, originates from the Yemeni city Mocha (or Mokha), long known for its coffee trade. The port city also gave its name to the famous Mocha coffee. But as the system gains strength over the Bay of Bengal, the interest has shifted from its name to its potential impact. As per the current forecasts, the system might intensify into a full-fledged cyclonic storm within the next two days. As of the India Meteorological Department, the circulation intensified into a low-pressure area over the Southeast Bay of Bengal adjoining the Andaman Sea today (May 8) morning at around 8.30 am. Initial forecasts indicate rapid growth, intensifying into a depression by Tuesday (May 9) and then into a cyclonic storm by Wednesday (May 10).</p>

We have made our concern explicit about the need for protection of people and property and the need for restitution and stabilisation. This is a humanitarian problem. We are concerned deeply about the loss of life and property,” Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud addressed the Centre and the Manipur government, represented by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.</p>

The 2023 Sudirman Cup is slated to be held from 14th to 21st May in Suzhou, China. As per a report in Times of India, the Indian contingent, which is currently training in Hyderabad, has a flight booked for 10th May to travel to China from Bengaluru. The Badminton Association of India (BAI) has reportedly escalated this matter to the Badminton World Federation (BWF) under whose aegis the Sudirman Cup is hosted. What is to be noted here is the fact that the Chinese contingent had faced a similar issue while travelling to India for the 2023 India Open earlier in the year. But, this issue was duly solved following the intervention of BAI</p>

There seems to be no limit to the capabilities of modern computers. But did you know that there are still several mathematical and computational tasks that even the most powerful computers available today cannot handle? Even if they become much faster in the future, such problems will remain beyond the scope of computers based on current classical technologies.</p>

While many fans chose to defend him by claiming that his actions were necessary and justified, others genuinely felt that the protagonist had crossed the line on several occasions and needed to be stopped. With the rise of AI in recent times, it has become more and more common to ask questions to chatbots like ChatGPT. We have done the same here, as we asked ChatGPT if Eren's actions were justified in Attack on Titan, and the AI's response was quite unexpected.</p>

A crisis of confidence in the U.S. banking sector has led to the failure of three midsized banks since March as depositors fled from smaller banks, with calls for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) to raise its $250,000 limit guarantee on deposits.</p>

At a coronation with displays of royal power straight out of the Middle Ages, Charles was given an orb, a sword and scepter and had the solid gold, bejeweled St. Edward's Crown placed atop his head as he sat upon a 700-year-old oak chair. In front of world leaders, foreign royals, dignitaries, and a smattering of stars, the monarch declared, I come not to be served but to serve, and was presented as Britain's 'undoubted king.' Inside the medieval abbey, trumpets sounded, and the congregation of more than 2,000 shouted 'God save the king!' Outside, thousands of troops, hundreds of thousands of spectators and scores of protesters converged.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Telugu actor Naga Chaitanya opened up about his divorce from Samantha Ruth Prabhu and the impact of his dating rumours on his equation with ex-wife Samantha Ruth Prabhu. The Custody actor was married to the Kushi star for almost four years before they announced their separation in 2021. While Chaitanya and Samantha have been tight-lipped about the reason behind their split, the actor confirmed that the divorce came through last year and they’ve been legally single for a year now. Speaking with the Times of India, Naga Chaitanya said that he and Samantha have moved on in their lives. Praising Samantha, Chaitanya said, “She is a lovely person and deserves all happiness. It is only when the media speculates that things get awkward between us. In the public eye, that mutual respect is taken away. That’s what I feel bad about. And you do what is worse? They bring in a third party, someone who is not connected to my part to create headlines out of that. It’s very disrespectful to the third party whom they are unnecessarily involving with my past.</p>

                </h5>
                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Uric acid, a crucial waste product, forms part of the most important anti-oxidants found in the biological fluids of humans. According to doctors, in normal circumstances, the uric acid levels should range between 3.5 to 7.2 milligram per deciliter (mg/dL). Uric acid is created when the human body breaks down purines which is a type of chemical. Health experts maintain that most uric acid dissolves in the blood, passes through the kidneys and leaves the body in urine. However, certain food and drinks like Seafood, red meat, organ meats like liver, alcohol (especially beer, including non-alcohol beer) etc., can lead to increased levels of uric acid in the body.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">If we had to list down some of the most striking features of our solar system, the iconic ring systems around certain planets — especially the glorious Saturn — would most definitely make it to the top. But what if we told you those spectacular rings may soon become a thing of the past? They may appear fixed from Earth, but astronomers have long known that Saturn's innermost rings erode into its upper atmosphere due to the planet's intense gravity. So powerful is this gravitational pull, that bits and pieces of these icy rings raining down on the planet can fill up an Olympic-sized swimming pool every day! To better understand just how fast the rings are disappearing, scientists have roped in NASA's incredible James Webb Space Telescope and Hawaii's Keck Observatory to carry out long-term observations of the 'ring rain' phenomenon. These observations will be made during an entire season on Saturn, which is equivalent to about seven years on Earth.</p>

The two-hour meeting began at 11:45 am ET (1545 GMT) and included Google's Sundar Pichai, Microsoft Corp's Satya Nadella, OpenAI's Sam Altman and Anthropic's Dario Amodei, along with Vice President Kamala Harris and administration officials including Biden's Chief of Staff Jeff Zients, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Director of the National Economic Council Lael Brainard and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. The growing popularity of generative AI, exemplified by ChatGPT and similar apps, has spurred companies to launch their own versions that they believe will revolutionize various industries. However, with millions of users already utilizing these tools for tasks such as medical diagnoses, writing screenplays, and debugging software, concerns have arisen over privacy violations, biased employment decisions, and the potential for scams and misinformation campaigns. President Biden, who has used ChatGPT himself, urged the officials to prioritize mitigating the current and potential risks AI poses to individuals, society, and national security. The White House highlighted the importance of AI companies ensuring the safety of their products before deployment.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">The channel of finances for terrorist activities must be blocked without any distinction and terrorism in all its forms, including cross-border terrorism, must be stopped, External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar said on Friday at a conclave of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) here in presence of his Pakistani counterpart Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari. In his address at the SCO Council of foreign Ministers' meeting, Mr. Jaishankar said taking the eyes off terrorism would be detrimental to the security interests of the grouping and that when the world was engaged in facing COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences, the menace of terrorism continued unabated, in an apparent reference to Pakistan.</p>

An internal order issued by Akashvani Director General Vasudha Gupta on Wednesday seeks compliance with immediate effect to the statutory provision which had replaced the name of AIR (All India Radio) to Akashvani. This is a very old decision of the government which was not operationalised earlier. We are now operationalising it, Gaurav Dwivedi, Chief Executive Officer, Prasar Bharati said.</p>

While it is not expected to cause a catastrophic event, the 1000-foot asteroid is almost the size of the Empire State Building and can cause regional damage if it were to hit a crowded city. The asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter is home to most of the asteroids in the solar system, and MIT scientists have developed a new method to study their internal structure based on their spin. This technique could help future missions, including the DART mission, which aims to deflect dangerous asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Russia today accused Ukraine of attempting to kill President Vladimir Putin. It claimed it shot down two drones which were used in the alleged attack. It said Russia reserved the right to retaliate - a comment that suggested that Moscow might use the alleged incident to justify a further escalation in the 14-month-old war with Ukraine. Putin was not injured and there was no material damage to the Kremlin building, it said, adding it considered the alleged attack.</p>

As its theatrical release inches closer, The Flash experienced many delays on top of the headline-making controversies from its lead star. Despite that, the hype for the Ezra Miller-led DC movie has been high in the past weeks, especially after rousing reviews from critics since it made its premiere at this year's CinemaCon.</p>

The fact that these stories share so many elements in common and come from people from diverse cultural backgrounds points to a possible biological mechanism -- one that has yet to be de-mystified by scientists.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Two-dimensional (2D) materials are promising candidates for future electronics. Although promising results on the wafer-scale synthesis of monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) have already been reported, the high-quality synthesis of 2D materials on wafers of 200 mm or larger, which are typically used in commercial silicon foundries, remains difficult. To prevent the chip from getting damaged, scientists also developed a low-temperature growth process that allows 2D semiconductor transistors to be directly integrated on top of standard silicon circuits.</p>

The poster shows the title written over a circular maze that swirls into a vortex; ‘Efforts Never Fail’ is written as the tagline of the film.

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">A team of scientists at Nasa have confirmed that there is oxygen on the airless world of the Moon as they extract the life-sustaining element from lunar soil. The new milestone could go a long way in sustaining a longer mission on the Moon, which has no air. Scientists at the Johnson Space Center extracted the oxygen from simulated lunar soil in a vacuum environment, paving the way for astronauts to one day extract and use resources in a lunar environment. They say that this oxygen could not only be used for breathing but also as fuel for transportation.</p>

Therefore, once every effort has been made to salvage the marriage and there remains no possibility of reunion and cohabitation, the court is not powerless in enabling the parties to avail a better option, which is to grant the divorce. The waiver is not to be given on mere asking, but on the court being satisfied beyond doubt that the marriage has shattered beyond repair.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Chronic stress is not good for health and we are aware of this fact. However, a new study conducted by American scientist's claims that stress can also lead to early ageing. Aside from the psychological and physiological impacts stress has on our body like for example, anxiety, inability to sleep, dark circles, anxiety, etc. stress can also accelerate biological ageing. So, not only is biological age determined by more than just the passage of time, but taking positive action could help prevent the body aging too quickly.</p>

Or, if you find it more appropriate, because one of its key members, the host, is at odds with the other two. Don’t fall for the temptation to say the more things change, the more they stay the same. There are indeed things that remain the same, like India’s slow strategic asphyxiation in the China-Pakistan pincer. Dr Manmohan Singh had described this as a straightforward case of China using Pakistan as a cheap instrument to ‘triangulate’ India. Beyond that, since he handed over the keys to Narendra Modi, much has changed.</p>

                </h5>
                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">As climate change causes ocean temperatures to rise, one of Greenland’s previously most stable glaciers is now retreating at an unprecedented rate, according to a new study. Led by researchers at The Ohio State University, a team found that between 2018 and 2021, Steenstrup Glacier in Greenland has retreated about 5 miles, thinned about 20%, doubled in the amount of ice it discharges into the ocean, and quadrupled in velocity. According to the study, such a rapid change is so extraordinary among Greenland ice formations that it now places Steenstrup in the top 10% of glaciers that contribute to the entire region’s total ice discharge.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Jeff Bezos beat large retailers by adopting the internet in the early 1990s through a combination of innovative thinking, strategic planning, and execution. At the time, most retailers were operating through brick-and-mortar stores, with very little online presence. However, Bezos saw the potential of the internet as a new sales channel, and he realised that by leveraging its reach, he could offer a much wider selection of products to customers than traditional retailers could.</p>

However, sometimes urine takes on a certain odor which can be because of varying reasons. An odor in urine is usually not a bad thing. However, it can be a cause of concern, especially if it's accompanied by other symptoms, such as blood in the urine or a burning sensation while peeing. Frequent trips to the bathroom could also indicate that there is a problem. If your urine is accompanied by a strong smell of ammonia, it can be a sign of a UTI.</p>

The title song 'Haegeum' raises the topic of 'freedom' to those who are bound by various restrictions and limitations in everyday life and society through the ambivalent expression of 'Haegeum' (奚琴), a Korean musical instrument, and 'Release the forbidden' (解禁).</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">The beginnings of this horror film are in a small village called Rudravanam in 1978 where we see a couple perform black magic and sacrifice a young girl to appease the gods for whatever reasons. The villagers stop the couple from killing their girl children and burn them to death for their heinous crimes. As the woman dies, she gives a curse that all the people in the village will die in 12 years. The villagers though let the couple’s son go and live in an orphanage outside the village and banish him from there.</p>

Social media likes, desirability quotient, non-acceptance as a child, a lack of human engagement, the reasons are many. Consequently, the relationship with food becomes an issue,' says Dr Shalini Naik, Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, PGI, Chandigarh.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Hepatocellular carcinoma is referred to as “liver cancer” as well. When normal liver cells undergo genetic alterations that cause them to become abnormal, the aberrant cells proliferate uncontrollably to become liver cancer tumour masses. Each year, this disease is discovered in more than 8,000 persons worldwide. With more than 7,00,000 fatalities from cancer each year, it is also one of the main cause of cancer mortality globally. Long-term liver illness (also known as chronic liver disease) is seen in more than half of patients who develop liver cancer.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">You are what you eat. The age-old aphorism has received a 21st-century genetic nod of approval, with an added caveat: when. A new study shows time-restricted eating (TRE), where food consumption is limited to a window of eight to 10 hours, regulates the nervous system and improves cognitive function and metabolic activity. Even though the study was conducted on mice, it expands the scope of nutrition epigenetics that looks at the connection between food and gene expressions, and how certain foods can activate specific genes. Conducted by researchers at the Salk Institute for Biological Research, US, the study, published in Cell Metabolism in January this year, found that TRE activated genes in over 22 regions of the body and brain. Almost 40 percent of the genes in the adrenal gland, hypothalamus and pancreas showed a shift, reiterating the positive effect of nutritional interventions in improving brain, heart, lungs, liver and gut health.</p>

The human module will land in the sea. He was speaking to reporters here after the successful launch of two Singaporean satellites, TeLEOS-2 and Lumilite-4, with the rocket Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). Somanath said prior to that, there would be a test of the Gagayaan Mission in June this year, where the rocket will go up to 12-14 km and test its safety systems.</p>

This has far-reaching implications for quantum communications tech (QCT), of key strategic significance to India and one of the four verticals for the mission’s R&D.

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Year after year, India continues to retain its position of the internet shutdown capital of the world. Internet shutdowns are broadly understood as the disruption of broadband or mobile-based internet access in a given geographic area as a result of a government directive. While these shutdowns are put in place to address some ‘harm’ that is facilitated by the internet, there is no rulebook in place for instances in which they can be ordered. Moreover, these measures fail to discriminate between innocuous and allegedly harmful uses of the internet. To top it all off, such shutdowns are ordered not by the legislature, but by the executive.</p>

There is no greater joy than receiving a box of kaju katli and binge-eating with the children glued to Netflix.

We spend about a third of our lives asleep. But some animals get a lot less slumber – with certain species like the northern elephant seal taking sleeplessness to an extreme. Researchers in a new study described the unusual sleep habits of this species, finding that during Pacific Ocean foraging journeys that can last seven months these bulky marine mammals sleep just two hours a day – cobbled together from naps of about 10 minutes each as they dive deep to avoid predators. The only other mammal known to get so little sleep is the African elephant.</p>

According to the industry people, there is a reason for the sudden IT Raids on Sukumar and Mythri movies.

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">If anything, climate change has certainly made conversations about the weather much more interesting. The topic has quickly shifted from effortless small talk to genuine concerns about coping with the growing summer heat every passing year. While most of these discussions may remain casual and based on 'feel', extensive scientific evidence actually supports their legitimacy as well. In addition to being a behemoth of a greenhouse gas emitter, many studies have shown that India is also one of the most vulnerable countries to projected climate change. And make no mistake, the change is already underway.</p>

It causes asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infection in birds. In addition, a high cross-species transmission ability makes the virus a potential source for the origination of other animal influenza viruses. The first human case of AIV infection (H3N8) was detected in China in April 2022. The patient was present with recurrent fever and severe pneumonia. The second case with mild influenza symptoms was detected in May 2022. These cases raised global concern about the possibility of a significant public health threat by H3N8 AIVs.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Sky watchers can catch a glimpse of a rare hybrid solar eclipse Thursday, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Australia as well as some locations in Southeast Asia will be able to see this rare occurrence on April 20. A hybrid solar eclipse is a combination of two other solar eclipses. In Thursday’s case, the hybrid eclipse will start with the moon completely blocking out the sun, a total eclipse, to it partially blocking out part of the sun, leaving just a “ring of fire” visible in the sky, an annular eclipse</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Unhealthy eating pattern in children coupled with sedentary lifestyle due to excessive screen time is putting them at risk of several lifestyle diseases early on in life. A diet high in sugar, fat and calories can cause fatty liver in kids. There may not be any symptoms of this condition in kids, however if the damage is greater children may report stomach pain, fatigue or jaundice. To treat fatty liver in kids, parents must work on making appropriate lifestyle modifications. Fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and other high-fibre foods must be added to the diet and daily exercise and playtime must be encouraged.</p>

It does not present any threat to humans, the US space agency said. Launched in 2002, the RHESSI observed solar flares and coronal mass ejections from its low-Earth orbit, helping scientists understand the underlying physics of how such powerful bursts of energy are created.</p>

                </h5>
                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">The leaked files have revealed that up to 50 Special Forces, most likely the SAS, have been sent to Ukraine. According to the records, it’s possible that more than half of the Special Forces soldiers from Western countries who were in Ukraine between February and March of this year were British. The revelation comes after more than a year of speculation that Western countries have also sent their troops to Ukraine, despite their “no boots on the ground” strategy in the ongoing conflict. The document, however, failed to specify what role these Special Forces have been asked to play in Ukraine.</p>

Arguably the greatest white-ball finisher of all time, the 41-year-old isn't at his fittest, but he can still pack a punch when needed.</p>

Boult removed Prithvi Shaw (Impact Player) and Manish Pandey in consecutive balls in the 200 chase. Ashwin joined the party as Delhi lost three wickets and managed 38 runs in the powerplay. Lalit Yadav and David Warner have kept things moving and added over 50 runs for the fourth wicket. Earlier, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Jos Buttler gave Rajasthan an explosive start after being invited to bat. The pair added 98 runs for the opening wicket before Mukesh Kumar removed the former for 60(31) in the 9th over. Delhi then fought their way back in the contest but Buttler along with Shimron Hetmyer helped Rajasthan regain control with some lusty blows towards the end of the innings. Buttler was caught-and-bowled by Mukesh for 79(51), while Hetmyer returned unbeaten on 39(21).</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Tech giant Google is planning to add artificial intelligence (AI) features to its search engine. This comes as it battles intense competition from Open AI's chatbot ChatGPT. In an interview to Wall Street Journal, Google chief executive officer (CEO) Sundar Pichai said that the new AI features will enhance the search engine's ability to answer queries. He rejected the notion that chatbots are a threat to Google's search business. The search business accounts for more than half of revenue at its parent Alphabet. The search ads are the biggest moneymaker for the company, bringing in $162 billion revenue last year.</p>

                <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">The market ended the first week of the financial year 2023-24 with gains of more than a percent. FII buying, a surprise rate pause by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and higher GST collection and manufacturing data, helped the indices close higher. Some consolidation is expected in the Nifty at around 17,600-17,700 but rotational buying across index majors will help in maintaining the positive tone, Ajit Mishra of Religare Broking has said.</p>

The clashes at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in the Old City of Jerusalem have raised tensions between Israelis and Palestinians, leading to rocket fire from both sides. The violence began on Monday when Israeli police stormed the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, which is considered one of the holiest sites in Islam, during Ramadan prayers. The move sparked outrage among Palestinians, who responded by throwing rocks and other objects at Israeli police. The police responded with stun grenades and tear gas, leading to violent clashes that left over 300 Palestinians and over 20 police officers injured.</p>

The world health body demanded that Beijing must immediately share all relevant information. From a theory that the virus jumped naturally to humans from animals and another saying that the virus likely leaked from a Wuhan laboratory, scientists have remained divided about the origins of the virus. A study claimed last month that raccoon dogs, known to be able to carry and transmit viruses that causes Covid, were at a market in Wuhan when the disease was first detected.</p>

This jump comes a day after the country reported 5,300 cases yesterday. With an uptick in the trend of Covid cases, scientists said that XBB.1.16 is the Covid-19 variant responsible for the present surge. However, scientists say that people in India have developed hybrid immunity (due to vaccination and natural infection). Therefore, the present Covid-19 variants will not cause a lot of hospitalization. However, the government has suggested people wear masks in crowded places and complete their vaccination doses if not done yet.</p>
