        If anything, climate change has certainly made conversations about the weather much more interesting. The topic has quickly shifted from effortless small talk to genuine concerns about coping with the growing summer heat every passing year. While most of these discussions may remain casual and based on 'feel', extensive scientific evidence actually supports their legitimacy as well. In addition to being a behemoth of a greenhouse gas emitter, many studies have shown that India is also one of the most vulnerable countries to projected climate change. And make no mistake, the change is already underway.

          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal"><p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday received a phone call from Bangladesh&#39;s interim head Muhammad Yunus and the two leaders exchanged views on the prevailing situation in the country following the ouster of Sheikh Hasina</p>

<p>In a post on X, PM Modi said he reiterated India&#39;s support for a &ldquo;democratic, stable, peaceful and progressive&rdquo; Bangladesh while Yunus assured him of the safety and security of Hindus and other minority communities living there.</p>

<p>PM Narendra Modi posted on X, &ldquo;Received a telephone call from Professor Muhammad Yunus, @ChiefAdviserGoB. Exchanged views on the prevailing situation. Reiterated India&#39;s support for a democratic, stable, peaceful and progressive Bangladesh. He assured protection, safety and security of Hindus and all minorities in Bangladesh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The assurance from Yunus comes after reports of attacks on members of the Hindu community living in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi had earlier asked for the safety and security of Hindus and other minorities of Bangladesh when he congratulated Yunus on the &ldquo;assumption of his new responsibilities&rdquo; as the chief advisor to the interim government.</p>

<div class="google-ad" id="google-ad-1">

</div>

<p>Modi also expressed concern about the security of Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh during his&nbsp;Independence Day speech&nbsp;on Thursday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a neighbouring country, I can understand the concern regarding whatever has happened in Bangladesh. I hope the situation there becomes normal soon,&rdquo; he said while addressing the nation from the Red Fort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In particular, the concerns of 140 crore Indians that the security of Hindus and minorities there is ensured,&rdquo; he said, speaking in Hindi.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bangladesh&rsquo;s de facto foreign minister Touhid Hossain told Reuters on Thursday that the interim government will decide whether to ask India to extradite Hasina as cases rise against her, including murder accusations. He said he didn&rsquo;t want to speculate but noted Hasina was facing &ldquo;so many cases&rdquo;.</p>

<p>If the home and law ministries decided, &ldquo;we have to ask for her...return to Bangladesh&rdquo;, Hossain said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That creates an embarrassing situation for the Indian government,&rdquo; he said, adding that India &ldquo;knows this and I am sure they will take care of it&rdquo;. He didn&rsquo;t elaborate. There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Hossain&rsquo;s remarks.</p>

          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal"><p>A large group of unidentified men stormed into Kolkata&rsquo;s RG Kar Medical College and Hospital around 12.40am on Thursday and destroyed hospital property at rampant in the middle of the junior doctors&rsquo; ongoing agitation against the August 9 rape and murder of a post-graduate trainee doctor. The incident took place while midnight protests named &lsquo;Reclaim the Night&rsquo; were being held by women against the horrific rape-murder of the doctor at the hospital.</p>

<p>Kolkata Police said 40 people, allegedly disguised as protestors, entered the hospital premises, vandalised property and cars, and pelted stones at the police.</p>

<p>BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari alleged that the vandalism was carried out by &quot;TMC goons&quot; sent by chief minister Mamata Banerjee.</p>

<p>The protests were a reaction to the rape and murder of a postgraduate trainee doctor at the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata while on duty.</p>

<p>The body of the 31-year-old woman was found on August 9 in the seminar hall of the hospital.</p>

<p>Kolkata police commissioner Vineet Goyal blamed the media for the mob attack on August 15, alleging that what happened was the result of &#39;wrong and malicious media campaign&#39;.</p>

<p>He said rumours about the main accused having political connections spread by the media had caused anger which led to the outburst. He added that the police could not arrest someone based on hearsay and asked for patience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have not done anything wrong... Because of this malicious media campaign, people have lost trust in Kolkata police,&rdquo; the commissioner said.</p>

          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Karat says Bhattacharjee was dedicated to what he had to do and the responsibilities assigned to him. But the same time, he had a certain detachment to see the larger picture. Former Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Prakash Karat was one of many political leaders who were close to late West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. Here’s what the Left leader had to say about the ex-CM. Just before the Emergency, in 1974, I had gone to Kolkata because our Student Federation of India’s head office was there at that time. In the Youth Federation Office, I found a young man in his kurta-pajama sitting at a desk and writing away furiously. Years later, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee epitomised an era of communist politics in West Bengal, which has now ended with this passing away. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was as a person and a leader someone who touched various aspects of life and society in West Bengal. He was no ordinary communist cadre. He was also a person with literary accomplishments. And he had made a distinctive contribution to the development of cultural institutions and cultural life in West Bengal as well. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee the administrator the chief minister and long time minister of the left Front government-- that is of course the most well known and most public aspect of his political life. But for us, we were more or less on the same generation. We both came into the Central Committee of the party in 1985 so we saw him as the party cadre, a party organizer and a party leader who started this work in the student movement and then the youth movement, and then he came into the leadership of the party in West Bengal as a state committee and state secretariat member. So what was so distinctive about him was his capacity to be totally devoted to his work. He was dedicated to what he has to do and the responsibilities assigned to him. But the same time, he had a certain detachment to see the larger picture. And as you know, he developed not just as a party functionary, but had active interest and passion for literature. He carried this tradition in West Bengal of being a Renaissance man. Personality, he represented everything that was progressive, democratic, secular in West Bengal and its cultural traditions. Within that framework, he was also a loyal party worker and a leader. He also tried to implement the party’s understanding of how the Left front government should function with all the limitations of a state government.</p>

          </h5>
          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">The Hindu Jagran Manch, an RSS-affiliated activist group, protested outside the Bangladesh High Commission in Kolkata in the wake of attacks on the Hindu communities in Bangladesh, amid political unrest. The Bangladesh Hindu, Buddhist, Christian Unity Council (BHCUC) told Reuters, that 200-300 mostly Hindu homes had been vandalised after Sheikh Hasina's resignation on Monday. Hindus form 8 per cent of Bangladesh's 170 million population and have historically been loyalists of the Awami League party, which is seen as largely secular. The ouster of Sheikh Hasina and the absence of a government for the past week has opened up the potential for atrocities against vulnerable populations such as Hindus, Christians and Buddhists. Students who led the protests have urged people not to target minority communities, even offering to guard temples from vandals. However, Reuters reported that several Hindu community leaders feel unsafe due to a lack of a functioning government. </p>

          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal"><p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday received a phone call from Bangladesh&#39;s interim head Muhammad Yunus and the two leaders exchanged views on the prevailing situation in the country following the ouster of Sheikh Hasina</p>

<p>In a post on X, PM Modi said he reiterated India&#39;s support for a &ldquo;democratic, stable, peaceful and progressive&rdquo; Bangladesh while Yunus assured him of the safety and security of Hindus and other minority communities living there.</p>

<p>PM Narendra Modi posted on X, &ldquo;Received a telephone call from Professor Muhammad Yunus, @ChiefAdviserGoB. Exchanged views on the prevailing situation. Reiterated India&#39;s support for a democratic, stable, peaceful and progressive Bangladesh. He assured protection, safety and security of Hindus and all minorities in Bangladesh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The assurance from Yunus comes after reports of attacks on members of the Hindu community living in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi had earlier asked for the safety and security of Hindus and other minorities of Bangladesh when he congratulated Yunus on the &ldquo;assumption of his new responsibilities&rdquo; as the chief advisor to the interim government.</p>

</div>

<p>Modi also expressed concern about the security of Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh during his&nbsp;Independence Day speech&nbsp;on Thursday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a neighbouring country, I can understand the concern regarding whatever has happened in Bangladesh. I hope the situation there becomes normal soon,&rdquo; he said while addressing the nation from the Red Fort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In particular, the concerns of 140 crore Indians that the security of Hindus and minorities there is ensured,&rdquo; he said, speaking in Hindi.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bangladesh&rsquo;s de facto foreign minister Touhid Hossain told Reuters on Thursday that the interim government will decide whether to ask India to extradite Hasina as cases rise against her, including murder accusations. He said he didn&rsquo;t want to speculate but noted Hasina was facing &ldquo;so many cases&rdquo;.</p>

<p>If the home and law ministries decided, &ldquo;we have to ask for her...return to Bangladesh&rdquo;, Hossain said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That creates an embarrassing situation for the Indian government,&rdquo; he said, adding that India &ldquo;knows this and I am sure they will take care of it&rdquo;. He didn&rsquo;t elaborate. There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Hossain&rsquo;s remarks.</p>

          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">The quake was centred off the eastern coast of Japan's southern main island of Kyushu at a depth of about 30 kilometres. A powerful earthquake measuring magnitude 7.1 struck the island of Kyushu in southern Japan on Thursday. Japanese public broadcaster NHK had earlier reported the quake's preliminary magnitude as 6.9. The earthquakes also triggered a tsunami, which has reached the western Miyazaki prefecture, according to NHK. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, the quake was centred off the eastern coast of Japan's southern main island of Kyushu at a depth of about 30 kilometres. The Japanese government has set up a special task force in response to the quakes, AFP reported, citing a a statement. There were no immediate signs of major damage, according to the agency. Japan, one of the world's most tectonically active countries, has strict building standards designed to ensure structures can withstand even the most powerful earthquakes. The archipelago, home to around 125 million people, experiences around 1,500 jolts every year. The vast majority of them are mild, although the damage they cause varies according to their location and the depth below the Earth's surface at which they strike.</p>

          </h5>
          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Hours after Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country amid violent anti-government protests, Army chief general Waker-Uz-Zaman announced that the military would form a caretaker government to restore peace and order in the country. After Sheikh Hasina's resignation, thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family, vandalising and looting the interiors. At least 300 people, including policemen, died during the renewed anti-government protests in Bangladesh that began on Friday. Similar protests took place last month after the Bangladesh high court reinstated a quota system for government jobs, including a 30% reservation for families of veterans from the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan, overturning a 2018 decision by Hasina's government to scrap it. However, the Supreme Court suspended the high court's order after the government's appeal, setting a date of August 7 to hear the government's challenge. The demonstrations escalated when Hasina refused to meet the students' demands, citing court proceedings.</p>

          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Raymonds and Singhania's family have been making headlines since the announcement of Chairman and Managing Director, Gautam Singhania's divorce with wife Nawaz Modi. As part of the divorce settlement, Modi has demanded 75 per cent of the Rs 11,660 crore property of Singhania. Now, Gautam Singhania's father and former MD of Raymond, Vijaypat Singhania has come out in support of Nawaz instead of his own son Gautam. Under the Hindu Marriage Act as I know, 50% of the husband's holding automatically goes to the wife in a separation. A very simple lawyer can get her that under the Hindu Marriage Act. Why is she fighting for 75%? Gautam is never going to give in because his motto is to buy everybody and buy everything. That's what he did with me. I didn't have that kind of money left to fight him. He bought everything. He'll buy everything. By fighting like this, I don't think she'll get much. Vijaypat Singhania, at one time, ran the whole Raymond empire. He was at that time one of the richest men in India. But today he lives in a rented apartment. he was once richer than Mukesh Ambani because Ambani was very young when Vijaypat was already the owner of Raymond Group. But, his fate took a turn when his son ousted him from his house. Vijaypat Singhania is struggling to maintain his life and is struggling to live a decent life.</p>

          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Drupal 11 continues enhancing the strengths of the platform. It makes structured content, workflows, and content governance more flexible and easier for ambitious builders. Drupal 11 is designed to empower ambitious site builders to build exceptional websites and to accelerate Drupal's innovation,” says Dries Buytaert, Founder and Project Lead of Drupal.  “With Drupal 11, we've made Drupal more intuitive, powerful, and flexible, ensuring it continues to lead in web development and digital experience creation. This latest version of Drupal brings together code and design for a refreshed CMS navigation experience, with an updated toolbar and a collapsible left-hand menu, all designed to ensure a seamless development experience. With new Recipes functionality, you can add new features to your website instantly by applying a set of predefined configuration. A recipe can provide anything that can be configured in Drupal, from a simple content type to a full suite of features. You can create your own recipes to share or reuse, or apply recipes created by other Drupal users. Recipes are experimental in this release but already usable and expected to be stable in 11.1. Single-Directory Components simplify front-end development by consolidating all necessary code into a single directory, making components self-contained and effortlessly reusable. Drupal’s high performance means it runs fast by default with swift page loading, and Drupal 11 is even faster than previous versions, running up to 50% faster on PHP 8.3.</p>

Pretty often, correct? The next usual step is heading to Shazam, humming the song, and hoping it understands the song despite your baritone. And once you hit the jackpot, you head to your choice of music app –– and for 82% of music listeners in India, YouTube is the popular choice –– and finally get the song in and out of your head.</p>

          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Despite grappling with the loss of a beloved fan, Taylor Swift's Eras Tour extended its remarkable streak of achievements, drawing the largest crowd ever assembled at Allianz Parque stadium in São Paulo, Brazil. The news broke out on November 24. After a delayed start due to the soaring temperatures, Taylor Swift eventually launched into the next leg of her concert in the arena. The crowd was incredibly energetic, and the atmosphere in the stadium was amazing. One can see the massive ferris wheel in Latin America honoring Taylor Swift with its enormous LED lights. Nevertheless, despite the excitement, some fans claimed that Taylor's vocals could hardly be heard over the loud, enthusiastic crowd. While interacting with Swifties on stage Taylor said “We have the best possible opening act on this tour and she absolutely played her heart out for you, so will you give it up again for the brilliant, the beautiful, and fantastic Sabrina Carpenter.”. The Lover singer's achievement came at a time when she was in the healing process and mourning the loss of her fan, Ana Clara Benevides Machado. Tragically, Ana Clara passed away after falling ill during Taylor Swift's concert, a casualty of the extreme heat wave. The incident thus resulted in the postponement and cancellation of performances in Brazil. One week following Ana Clara Benevides Machado's passing, Taylor Swift recently contacted her family via her team. Later, it was revealed that Taylor asked her team to be in touch with the deceased’s family.</p>

The 2023 Sudirman Cup is slated to be held from 14th to 21st May in Suzhou, China. As per a report in Times of India, the Indian contingent, which is currently training in Hyderabad, has a flight booked for 10th May to travel to China from Bengaluru. The Badminton Association of India (BAI) has reportedly escalated this matter to the Badminton World Federation (BWF) under whose aegis the Sudirman Cup is hosted. What is to be noted here is the fact that the Chinese contingent had faced a similar issue while travelling to India for the 2023 India Open earlier in the year. But, this issue was duly solved following the intervention of BAI</p>

          </h5>
          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">The Sun is experiencing a sudden surge in activity with a significant rise in the number of sunspots which are sending plumes of hot plasma out into space, the impact of which is expected to be felt by Earth in the form of geomagnetic storms triggered radio blackouts, reported Newsweek citing a NASA model. The Sun’s surface is covered with dark spots which are called sunspots where the magnetic field is very strong and in the last week or so, the number of these black pockmarks has increased tenfold and are said to be spewing out several coronal mass ejections (CMEs) every day. A report by Newsweek citing NASA model said that one of these CMEs – large expulsions of clouds of plasma from the Sun’s corona at high speeds – is expected to hit our magnetic field and atmosphere late on November 25. The Sun may also send out solar flares which are bright bursts of electromagnetic energy. “Solar flares and CME are both caused by the sun through its magnetic field being twisted and stressed through motions in the sun,” Daniel Brown, an associate professor in astronomy and science communication at Nottingham Trent University in the United Kingdom, told Newsweek. He added, “However, a solar flare is the immense release of light triggered by the snapping and rearranging of the magnetic fields on the sun. That will go hand in hand typically with the release of a CME. But it will take a day or more for the particles to arrive while the light and radiation reaches us in just over 8 minutes.” A report by Spaceweather.com said that the rise in sunspots began on November 18 when AR3490, the first sunspot group, emerged on the Sun’s northeastern side. Subsequently, another sunspot group, AR3491 emerged and is said to have formed a trail behind it.</p>

          </h5>
          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">In a recent clinical trial published in JAMA Network Open, researchers from the United States of America (USA) assessed and compared the effectiveness of acupuncture and massage therapy for musculoskeletal pain in 298 patients with advanced cancer. They found that both treatments could reduce pain, fatigue, and insomnia in patients while improving their quality of life (QoL) over 26 weeks. The QoL of about 67% of patients with advanced cancer is hampered by pain, a debilitating symptom that often presents with fatigue and insomnia. Although the treatment of pain in these patients relies majorly on the use of opioids, the ongoing opioid crisis limits the prescription of and access to these drugs. Additionally, the potential side effects of such medications underscore the increased need and preference for alternative therapies for pain management. The 2022 guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the Society for Integrative Oncology recommend using acupuncture and massage for oncologic pain management. Evidence suggests that acupuncture is effective in treating pain in cancer survivors, but there’s a dearth of studies explicitly conducted on patients with advanced cancer. The long-term benefits of massage in cancer pain management have also not been thoroughly investigated or compared with those of acupuncture.</p>

There is an estimated 392 million people living with COPD and three quarters of them live in low- and middle-income countries. Tobacco smoking accounts for over 70% of COPD cases in high-income countries. In low-and-middle-income-countries tobacco smoking accounts for 30–40% of COPD cases with household air pollution being the other major risk factor. People living with COPD face a greater risk of developing lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and type 2 diabetes. The COVID-19 pandemic has further underscored the challenges in accessing healthcare for these individuals. Quitting smoking will not only reduce your risk of COPD but also significantly reduces the risk of these severe coexisting conditions.</p>

Covering your mouth and nose using anti-pollution masks is one of the most effective ways</p>

          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Suvendu Adhikari files complaint against Mamata Banerjee for criminal intimidation and threats. Leader of the Opposition in the West Bengal Assembly Suvendu Adhikari has filed a formal complaint against West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee alleging criminal intimidation and threats made by the the Trinamool Congress supremo during a recent political event. Adhikari, outlining a series of grievances, alleged that since his shift in political allegiance, he has faced numerous vexatious and concocted cases. He claimed that the ruling Trinamool Congress, led by Mamata Banerjee, has consistently promoted ill will and hatred towards him and his political party members. The complaint specifically points to Banerjee's speech at the Netaji Indoor Stadium on Thursday, where she reportedly made remarks indicating that if four MLAs of her political party are sent to jail, she will ensure the incarceration of eight individuals from the opposition party on murder charges under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code. Banerjee claimed that central agencies currently targeting opposition leaders will be after the BJP post-2024 Lok Sabha polls, asserting that the government at the Centre will last for three more months.</p>

          </h5>
          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot shares a video message by Sachin Pilot urging people to vote for Congress. Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday shared a video post on X (formerly Twitter) of Congress leader Sachin Pilot urging people to vote for his party in the upcoming assembly election, putting to rest speculations of an intra-party dispute between both the senior leaders in the state. This comes days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, campaigning for the upcoming Rajasthan assembly election, took an indirect dig at both leaders referring to the power tussle between them. Earlier, PM Modi pointed out that despite both the ‘rivals’ within the grand old party shaking hands on multiple occasions over the years, there has been no reconciliation between them. “In cricket, a batter comes and scores runs for his team. But there is so much infighting within the Congress that instead of scoring runs, its leaders spent five years trying to run out each other,” the Prime Minister said. Referring that it is a thing of the past, Pilot tried to downplay the speculations about the feud. “We met (Congress president Mallikarjun) Kharge and (Rahul) Gandhi... the party took cognisance (of my concerns)… The party high command told me to forgive and forget, and move on,” NDTV reported quoting the former Rajasthan deputy CM.</p>

Chandrababu Naidu on Monday was granted regular bail by the Andhra Pradesh high court in the skill development case, ANI reported. The Telugu Desam Party chief is on interim bail till November 28. On October 31, the high court granted a four-week interim bail to the former Andhra Pradesh chief minister on medical grounds. He had been lodged in the Rajahmundry central prison since September 10, a day after being arrested by the Crime Investigation Department (CID) in the multi-crore skill development corporation scam and was remanded to judicial custody by the Special Court for the ACB cases in Vijayawada. In March this year, the CID had initiated a probe into alleged scam worth ₹3,300 crore in the APSSDC during the previous TDP regime.</p>
