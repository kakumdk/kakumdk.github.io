Dix is aiding the rescue process. At the moment, it's like we are there at the front door and we are knocking on it. We know that the guys are there on the other side. I am going to have a look and see what is happening, he said after reaching the tunnel site.

More than 40 mechanised boats were gutted when a massive fire broke out in the fishing harbour of Andhra Pradesh’s Visakhapatnam early on Monday, police said. The fire erupted in one of the boats harboured at a jetty around midnight, triggering in an explosion of its diesel engine. Soon, the fire spread to adjacent boats and the entire Viskahapatnam fishing harbour was engulfed inthe blaze. A group of fishermen present at the harbour raised an alarm and alerted the police. “Soon after coming to know about the fire mishap, the police rushed there along with three fire tenders, followed by another three fire tenders to extinguish the fire.

Iran executed a 17-year-old convicted of murder, two rights groups said as the country continues to hang people for crimes committed as minors. Hamidreza Azari was executed in prison in the eastern town of Sabzevar in Razavi Khorasan province, the Norway-based Hengaw and Iran Human Rights (IHR) groups said as per news agency AFP. Hamidreza Azari was the only child in his family and had already started working as a scrap worker. The rights groups said that he was 16 years old at the time of the crime and 17 when executed. Hamidreza Azari had reportedly been sentenced to death for killing a man in a brawl in May this year. The rights groups said that the execution marked another violation by Iran of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The convention defines a child as any person under the age of 18. Earlier, Iran also executed a man in his early 20s who was the eighth person to be hanged in a case related to months of nationwide protests that erupted in September 2022.</p>

Indians form the third largest population of illegal immigrants in the US, numbering around 725,000, Pew Research Center has found. Mexico and El Salvador follow the US in the list. The research also found that the country’s 10.5 million unauthorised immigrants represented approximately three per cent of the total population in the US. It further represented 22 per cent of the foreign-born population. Data from US Customs and Border Protection suggests that a massive number of undocumented Indian immigrants are crossing the US borders on foot. As many as 6,917 Indians were apprehended, expelled or denied entry for entering the US without documents between October 2022 to September 2023. The number of undocumented Indians in the US went up significantly after borders opened due to the Covid-19 pandemic. While 30,662 encountered in the 2021 fiscal year, 63,927 encountered in the 2022 fiscal year. With 97,000 encounters this year, 30,010 were at the Canadian border and 41,770 at the Southern border.</p>

China has reported an outbreak of influenza-like illness mostly among children prompting the World Health Organization to seek more details from the country about the mysterious outbreak. According to reports, Chinese hospitals are overwhelmed with sick children who have symptoms of respiratory illness. WHO said Chinese authorities from the National Health Commission held a press conference on November 12 and reported an increase in respiratory diseases in the country. They attributed this to the lifting of the Covid-19 restrictions. WHO has sought additional information on recent trends in the circulation of known pathogens, including influenza, SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that gives rise to Covid-19), RSV affecting infants and Mycoplasma pneumonia, as well as on the degree of overcrowding in the health system, the statement added.</p>

          </h5>
          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Authorities in Iceland are concerned about severe weather conditions ahead of an imminent volcanic eruption. The eruption is expected to take place in Grindavik, a fishing port around 40 kilometres from capital Reykjavik. The 4,000 residents of the city were evacuated on November 11 after magma shifting under the Earth's crust caused hundreds of earthquake. The Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) has now said that volcanic eruption could take place just 30 minutes' notice as magma is now sitting just below the earth's surface, according to a report in Independent. Ms Jonsdottir attributed the prediction to decreasing earthquake activity, which she said could also be a sign that magma has reached very close to the earth's surface. Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir, meanwhile, has said that no other country than Iceland is better prepared for volcanos and other natural disasters. The last volcanic eruption in the Reykjanes peninsula took place in 2021. It was the first one in eight centuries.</p>

          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Raymonds and Singhania's family have been making headlines since the announcement of Chairman and Managing Director, Gautam Singhania's divorce with wife Nawaz Modi. As part of the divorce settlement, Modi has demanded 75 per cent of the Rs 11,660 crore property of Singhania. Now, Gautam Singhania's father and former MD of Raymond, Vijaypat Singhania has come out in support of Nawaz instead of his own son Gautam. Under the Hindu Marriage Act as I know, 50% of the husband's holding automatically goes to the wife in a separation. A very simple lawyer can get her that under the Hindu Marriage Act. Why is she fighting for 75%? Gautam is never going to give in because his motto is to buy everybody and buy everything. That's what he did with me. I didn't have that kind of money left to fight him. He bought everything. He'll buy everything. By fighting like this, I don't think she'll get much. Vijaypat Singhania, at one time, ran the whole Raymond empire. He was at that time one of the richest men in India. But today he lives in a rented apartment. he was once richer than Mukesh Ambani because Ambani was very young when Vijaypat was already the owner of Raymond Group. But, his fate took a turn when his son ousted him from his house. Vijaypat Singhania is struggling to maintain his life and is struggling to live a decent life.</p>

Pretty often, correct? The next usual step is heading to Shazam, humming the song, and hoping it understands the song despite your baritone.

          </h5>
          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Despite grappling with the loss of a beloved fan, Taylor Swift's Eras Tour extended its remarkable streak of achievements, drawing the largest crowd ever assembled at Allianz Parque stadium in São Paulo, Brazil. The news broke out on November 24. After a delayed start due to the soaring temperatures, Taylor Swift eventually launched into the next leg of her concert in the arena. The crowd was incredibly energetic, and the atmosphere in the stadium was amazing. One can see the massive ferris wheel in Latin America honoring Taylor Swift with its enormous LED lights. Nevertheless, despite the excitement, some fans claimed that Taylor's vocals could hardly be heard over the loud, enthusiastic crowd. While interacting with Swifties on stage Taylor said “We have the best possible opening act on this tour and she absolutely played her heart out for you, so will you give it up again for the brilliant, the beautiful, and fantastic Sabrina Carpenter.”. The Lover singer's achievement came at a time when she was in the healing process and mourning the loss of her fan, Ana Clara Benevides Machado. Tragically, Ana Clara passed away after falling ill during Taylor Swift's concert, a casualty of the extreme heat wave. The incident thus resulted in the postponement and cancellation of performances in Brazil. One week following Ana Clara Benevides Machado's passing, Taylor Swift recently contacted her family via her team. Later, it was revealed that Taylor asked her team to be in touch with the deceased’s family.</p>

          </h5>
          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">India's participation in the prestigious Sudirman Cup lingers in doubt with the visa applications of the entire 23-member contingent, including PV Sindhu and HS Prannoy, yet to be cleared by the Chinese embassy in Delhi. The 2023 Sudirman Cup is slated to be held from 14th to 21st May in Suzhou, China. As per a report in Times of India, the Indian contingent, which is currently training in Hyderabad, has a flight booked for 10th May to travel to China from Bengaluru. The Badminton Association of India (BAI) has reportedly escalated this matter to the Badminton World Federation (BWF) under whose aegis the Sudirman Cup is hosted. What is to be noted here is the fact that the Chinese contingent had faced a similar issue while travelling to India for the 2023 India Open earlier in the year. But, this issue was duly solved following the intervention of BAI</p>

          </h5>
          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">The Sun is experiencing a sudden surge in activity with a significant rise in the number of sunspots which are sending plumes of hot plasma out into space, the impact of which is expected to be felt by Earth in the form of geomagnetic storms triggered radio blackouts, reported Newsweek citing a NASA model. The Sun’s surface is covered with dark spots which are called sunspots where the magnetic field is very strong and in the last week or so, the number of these black pockmarks has increased tenfold and are said to be spewing out several coronal mass ejections (CMEs) every day. A report by Newsweek citing NASA model said that one of these CMEs – large expulsions of clouds of plasma from the Sun’s corona at high speeds – is expected to hit our magnetic field and atmosphere late on November 25. The Sun may also send out solar flares which are bright bursts of electromagnetic energy. “Solar flares and CME are both caused by the sun through its magnetic field being twisted and stressed through motions in the sun,” Daniel Brown, an associate professor in astronomy and science communication at Nottingham Trent University in the United Kingdom, told Newsweek. He added, “However, a solar flare is the immense release of light triggered by the snapping and rearranging of the magnetic fields on the sun. That will go hand in hand typically with the release of a CME. But it will take a day or more for the particles to arrive while the light and radiation reaches us in just over 8 minutes.” A report by Spaceweather.com said that the rise in sunspots began on November 18 when AR3490, the first sunspot group, emerged on the Sun’s northeastern side. Subsequently, another sunspot group, AR3491 emerged and is said to have formed a trail behind it.</p>

ESA officials earlier reported a “light anomaly” during the test in French Guiana, which involved igniting the core-stage Vulcain 2.1 engine followed by seven minutes of operation without a lift-off. ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher said last month there was light at the end of tunnel for the delayed launcher and indicated a window for an inaugural launch in 2024 would be established following the long-duration firing test. </p>

          </h5>
          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">In a recent clinical trial published in JAMA Network Open, researchers from the United States of America (USA) assessed and compared the effectiveness of acupuncture and massage therapy for musculoskeletal pain in 298 patients with advanced cancer. They found that both treatments could reduce pain, fatigue, and insomnia in patients while improving their quality of life (QoL) over 26 weeks. The QoL of about 67% of patients with advanced cancer is hampered by pain, a debilitating symptom that often presents with fatigue and insomnia. Although the treatment of pain in these patients relies majorly on the use of opioids, the ongoing opioid crisis limits the prescription of and access to these drugs. Additionally, the potential side effects of such medications underscore the increased need and preference for alternative therapies for pain management. The 2022 guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the Society for Integrative Oncology recommend using acupuncture and massage for oncologic pain management. Evidence suggests that acupuncture is effective in treating pain in cancer survivors, but there’s a dearth of studies explicitly conducted on patients with advanced cancer. The long-term benefits of massage in cancer pain management have also not been thoroughly investigated or compared with those of acupuncture.</p>

          </h5>
          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">A new brief reveals that smoking remains one of the leading causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a common lung disease that causes breathing problem and claiming the lives of over 3 million people every year. There is an estimated 392 million people living with COPD and three quarters of them live in low- and middle-income countries. Tobacco smoking accounts for over 70% of COPD cases in high-income countries. In low-and-middle-income-countries tobacco smoking accounts for 30–40% of COPD cases with household air pollution being the other major risk factor. People living with COPD face a greater risk of developing lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and type 2 diabetes. The COVID-19 pandemic has further underscored the challenges in accessing healthcare for these individuals. Quitting smoking will not only reduce your risk of COPD but also significantly reduces the risk of these severe coexisting conditions.</p>

          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Suvendu Adhikari files complaint against Mamata Banerjee for criminal intimidation and threats. Leader of the Opposition in the West Bengal Assembly Suvendu Adhikari has filed a formal complaint against West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee alleging criminal intimidation and threats made by the the Trinamool Congress supremo during a recent political event. Adhikari, outlining a series of grievances, alleged that since his shift in political allegiance, he has faced numerous vexatious and concocted cases. He claimed that the ruling Trinamool Congress, led by Mamata Banerjee, has consistently promoted ill will and hatred towards him and his political party members. The complaint specifically points to Banerjee's speech at the Netaji Indoor Stadium on Thursday, where she reportedly made remarks indicating that if four MLAs of her political party are sent to jail, she will ensure the incarceration of eight individuals from the opposition party on murder charges under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code. Banerjee claimed that central agencies currently targeting opposition leaders will be after the BJP post-2024 Lok Sabha polls, asserting that the government at the Centre will last for three more months.</p>

          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot shares a video message by Sachin Pilot urging people to vote for Congress. Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday shared a video post on X (formerly Twitter) of Congress leader Sachin Pilot urging people to vote for his party in the upcoming assembly election, putting to rest speculations of an intra-party dispute between both the senior leaders in the state. This comes days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, campaigning for the upcoming Rajasthan assembly election, took an indirect dig at both leaders referring to the power tussle between them. Earlier, PM Modi pointed out that despite both the ‘rivals’ within the grand old party shaking hands on multiple occasions over the years, there has been no reconciliation between them. “In cricket, a batter comes and scores runs for his team. But there is so much infighting within the Congress that instead of scoring runs, its leaders spent five years trying to run out each other,” the Prime Minister said. Referring that it is a thing of the past, Pilot tried to downplay the speculations about the feud. “We met (Congress president Mallikarjun) Kharge and (Rahul) Gandhi... the party took cognisance (of my concerns)… The party high command told me to forgive and forget, and move on,” NDTV reported quoting the former Rajasthan deputy CM.</p>

In March this year, the CID had initiated a probe into alleged scam worth ₹3,300 crore in the APSSDC during the previous TDP regime.</p>
