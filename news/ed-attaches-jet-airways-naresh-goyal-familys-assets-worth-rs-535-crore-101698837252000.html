Union minister Piyush Goyal met US President Joe Biden at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) welcome reception on Thursday. Piyush Goyal told news agency ANI that Joe Biden had conveyed his greetings to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and he acknowledged that the countries which were not responsible for creating the environmental degradation in the first place are the countries which get impacted the most. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation grouping has 21 members. However, India is not one of them. It had made a request to join the grouping in 1991. While a majority of members are in favour of India's inclusion, some have opposed it, citing the country's record on economic reforms and claiming that it has' protectionist instincts'. Another reason for India not being included in the grouping was a membership freeze, which was in force since 1997 but was not extended in 2012.</p>

          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">As the rescue operation to evacuate 40 labourers trapped in a tunnel in Uttarakhand entered its fifth day on Thursday, Union Minister VK Singh visited the site and said it may take 2-3 more days for the task to be completed. The minister of state for road transport and highways said the rescue could be finished sooner, even as early as Friday, but the government is keeping a longer timeline in mind to account for unexpected difficulties. The minister's statement came even as a faster and more powerful 'American auger' machine began work at Silkyara Tunnel in Uttarkashi to push through a pipe that will be used to rescue the construction workers, who have been trapped in the tunnel since Sunday morning. He also confirmed that the rescue teams have spoken to foreign experts, including a firm that helped save 12 children and their football coach who were stranded in a cave in Thailand. Our priority is to ensure the trapped workers are safe and are rescued at the earliest. Everyone, from the Prime Minister to the chief minister, is helping in every way they can. We faced some problems with the machine that was being used earlier and a faster, more powerful, machine has now been deployed.</p>

Police are questioning senior officials of the factory. Four migrant labourers from Bihar lost their lives due to suffocation while working inside a septic tank in a village in Surat, police said on Wednesday. The incident occurred at a dyeing factory on Palsana-Katodara road on Tuesday evening. Preliminary investigation suggests that two workers initially fell unconscious during the septic tank cleaning process, prompting two others to attempt a rescue, a police official aware of the matter said. H L Rathore, Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), Bardoli Division, said that the senior officials of the factory are being questioned. The process of identifying the deceased individuals, who hail from Bihar, is currently underway, the official added.</p>

          </h5>
          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">A court in Kerala on Tuesday sentenced to death a 29-year-old man for the brutal rape and murder of a five-year-old girl in Aluva, bringing the curtain down on a grisly murder that shook the southern state and sparked sweeping outrage. Asafaq Alam, a migrant worker from Bihar who was out on bail in connection with a Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act for molesting a minor girl in Delhi when he committed the crime in Aluva, was convicted by the court on November 4.

Union minister Piyush Goyal met US President Joe Biden at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) welcome reception on Thursday. Piyush Goyal told news agency ANI that Joe Biden had conveyed his greetings to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and he acknowledged that the countries which were not responsible for creating the environmental degradation in the first place are the countries which get impacted the most. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation grouping has 21 members. However, India is not one of them. It had made a request to join the grouping in 1991. While a majority of members are in favour of India's inclusion, some have opposed it, citing the country's record on economic reforms and claiming that it has' protectionist instincts'. Another reason for India not being included in the grouping was a membership freeze, which was in force since 1997 but was not extended in 2012.</p>

          </h5>
          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">In a recent clinical trial published in JAMA Network Open, researchers from the United States of America (USA) assessed and compared the effectiveness of acupuncture and massage therapy for musculoskeletal pain in 298 patients with advanced cancer. They found that both treatments could reduce pain, fatigue, and insomnia in patients while improving their quality of life (QoL) over 26 weeks. The QoL of about 67% of patients with advanced cancer is hampered by pain, a debilitating symptom that often presents with fatigue and insomnia. Although the treatment of pain in these patients relies majorly on the use of opioids, the ongoing opioid crisis limits the prescription of and access to these drugs. Additionally, the potential side effects of such medications underscore the increased need and preference for alternative therapies for pain management. The 2022 guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the Society for Integrative Oncology recommend using acupuncture and massage for oncologic pain management. Evidence suggests that acupuncture is effective in treating pain in cancer survivors, but there’s a dearth of studies explicitly conducted on patients with advanced cancer. The long-term benefits of massage in cancer pain management have also not been thoroughly investigated or compared with those of acupuncture.</p>

          </h5>
          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">A new brief reveals that smoking remains one of the leading causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a common lung disease that causes breathing problem and claiming the lives of over 3 million people every year. There is an estimated 392 million people living with COPD and three quarters of them live in low- and middle-income countries. Tobacco smoking accounts for over 70% of COPD cases in high-income countries. In low-and-middle-income-countries tobacco smoking accounts for 30–40% of COPD cases with household air pollution being the other major risk factor. People living with COPD face a greater risk of developing lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and type 2 diabetes. The COVID-19 pandemic has further underscored the challenges in accessing healthcare for these individuals. Quitting smoking will not only reduce your risk of COPD but also significantly reduces the risk of these severe coexisting conditions.</p>

          </h5>
          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">How many times have you woken up with a tune stuck in your head, and you just can’t remember the lyrics but also can’t let go of the tune until you figure out what song it is? Pretty often, correct? The next usual step is heading to Shazam, humming the song, and hoping it understands the song despite your baritone. And once you hit the jackpot, you head to your choice of music app –– and for 82% of music listeners in India, YouTube is the popular choice –– and finally get the song in and out of your head.</p>

The 2023 Sudirman Cup is slated to be held from 14th to 21st May in Suzhou, China. As per a report in Times of India, the Indian contingent, which is currently training in Hyderabad, has a flight booked for 10th May to travel to China from Bengaluru. The Badminton Association of India (BAI) has reportedly escalated this matter to the Badminton World Federation (BWF) under whose aegis the Sudirman Cup is hosted. What is to be noted here is the fact that the Chinese contingent had faced a similar issue while travelling to India for the 2023 India Open earlier in the year.

          </h5>
          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">In a recent clinical trial published in JAMA Network Open, researchers from the United States of America (USA) assessed and compared the effectiveness of acupuncture and massage therapy for musculoskeletal pain in 298 patients with advanced cancer. They found that both treatments could reduce pain, fatigue, and insomnia in patients while improving their quality of life (QoL) over 26 weeks. The QoL of about 67% of patients with advanced cancer is hampered by pain, a debilitating symptom that often presents with fatigue and insomnia. Although the treatment of pain in these patients relies majorly on the use of opioids, the ongoing opioid crisis limits the prescription of and access to these drugs. Additionally, the potential side effects of such medications underscore the increased need and preference for alternative therapies for pain management. The 2022 guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the Society for Integrative Oncology recommend using acupuncture and massage for oncologic pain management. Evidence suggests that acupuncture is effective in treating pain in cancer survivors, but there’s a dearth of studies explicitly conducted on patients with advanced cancer. The long-term benefits of massage in cancer pain management have also not been thoroughly investigated or compared with those of acupuncture.</p>

          </h5>
          <p class="fs-15 font-weight-normal">A new brief reveals that smoking remains one of the leading causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a common lung disease that causes breathing problem and claiming the lives of over 3 million people every year. There is an estimated 392 million people living with COPD and three quarters of them live in low- and middle-income countries. Tobacco smoking accounts for over 70% of COPD cases in high-income countries. In low-and-middle-income-countries tobacco smoking accounts for 30–40% of COPD cases with household air pollution being the other major risk factor. People living with COPD face a greater risk of developing lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and type 2 diabetes. The COVID-19 pandemic has further underscored the challenges in accessing healthcare for these individuals. Quitting smoking will not only reduce your risk of COPD but also significantly reduces the risk of these severe coexisting conditions.</p>
